# USAGE: sort-includes.pl filename.cc >filename.cc.sorted
#
# This tool helps to sort the #include directives in a c or c++ source file
# according to the Squid Coding guidelines.
#
# The output of the tool is a source file where each block of consecutive
# include directives for project-specific files (#include "header.h")
# is sorted with this specification: squid.h (if present) is always first,
# then the other directives are sorted in case-insensitive alphabetical order.
#
# Suggested usage:
# for file in $(find . -name \*.cc); do /full/path/to/sort-includes.pl $file >$file.sorted; mv $file.sorted $file; done
