#  TERMS OF USE
#    
#    The Harvest software may be used and re-distributed without
#    charge, provided that the software origin and research team are
#    cited in any use of the system.  Most commonly this is
#    accomplished by including a link to the Harvest Home Page
#    (http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/) from the query page of any
#    Broker you deploy, as well as in the query result pages.  These
#    links are generated automatically by the standard Broker

#  DERIVATIVE WORKS
#  
#    Users may make derivative works from the Harvest software, subject

#  
#      - You must include the above copyright notice and these 
#        accompanying paragraphs in all forms of derivative works,

#        distribution and use acknowledge that the software was 
#        developed at the above institutions.
#  
#      - You must notify IRTF-RD regarding your distribution of 
#        the derivative work.
#  
#      - You must clearly notify users that your are distributing 
#        a modified version and not the original Harvest software.
#  
#      - Any derivative product is also subject to these copyright 
#        and use restrictions.

#    Note that the Harvest software is NOT in the public domain.  We

#  
#  HISTORY OF FREE SOFTWARE STATUS
#  
#    Originally we required sites to license the software in cases
#    where they were going to build commercial products/services
#    around Harvest.  In June 1995 we changed this policy.  We now
#    allow people to use the core Harvest software (the code found in
#    the Harvest ``src/'' directory) for free.  We made this change
#    in the interest of encouraging the widest possible deployment of
#    the technology.  The Harvest software is really a reference
#    implementation of a set of protocols and formats, some of which
#    we intend to standardize.  We encourage commercial
#    re-implementations of code complying to this set of standards.
