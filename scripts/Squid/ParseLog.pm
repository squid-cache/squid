# This is a simple module which takes in a Squid format logfile line and breaks it up into
# a perl hash.
# 
# I'm not going to pretend this is 100% accurate just yet but its a start.
# I'm hoping that by placing it into the public domain it (and the other stuff
# I sneak in here) will be debugged and improved by others.
