#ifndef SQUID_COMPAT_KRB5_H

/*
 * The Kerberos library krb5.h header file has various major
 * bugs in some implementations:
 *
 * - MacOS marks as deprecated the POSIX compatible APIs.
 *   Apparently to encourage code to use their internal APIs.
 *
 * - Heimdal may lack the extern "C" syntax for building in C++
 *
 * - Solaris incorrectly implements its own the extern "C" replacement
 *   macros and as a result krb5.h contains a trailing '}'.
 *   see http://bugs.opensolaris.org/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6837512
 *
 * This file exists to fix those issues the best we can and to
 * ensure the logic is identical in Squid code, Squid helpers,
 * and autoconf tests. See acinclude/krb5.h for the latter.
