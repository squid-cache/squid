# Component Missing Libraries Check - everything MUST work at this level
MAKETEST="distcheck"
#
# Currently tested components with plug-in-play capability:
#
#	ESI - optional libexpat, libxml2
#
# NP: there must be no overlap in code for plugging the libraries in/out.
#     this means we can test the absence of all in one run and save time.
#
# NP: DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS is a magic automake macro for the 
#     distcheck target recursive tests beteen scripted runs.
#     we use it to perform the same duty between our nested scripts.
