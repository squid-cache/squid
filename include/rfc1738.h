/**
 * RFC 1738 URL-escaping
 *
 * Public API is formed of a triplet of encode functions mapping to the rfc1738_do_encode() engine.
 *
 * ASCII characters are split into four groups:
 * \li SAFE     Characters which are safe to occur in any URL. For example A,B,C
 * \li CTRLS    Binary control codes. Dangerous to include in URLs.
 * \li UNSAFE   Characters which are completely usafe to occur in any URL. For example; backspace, tab, space, newline.
 * \li RESERVED Characters which are reserved for special meaning and may only occur in certain parts of a URL.
 *
 * Returns a static buffer containing the RFC 1738 compliant, escaped version of the given url.
 *
 * \param flags  RFC1738_ESCAPE_CTRLS     Encode the blatantly dangerous binary codes.
 * \param flags  RFC1738_ESCAPE_UNSAFE    Encode printable unsafe characters (excluding CTRLs).
 * \param flags  RFC1738_ESCAPE_RESERVED  Encode reserved characters.
 * \param flags  RFC1738_ESCAPE_ALL       Encode all binary CTRL, unsafe and reserved characters.
 * \param flags  RFC1738_ESCAPE_NOSPACE   Ignore the space whitespace character.
 * \param flags  RFC1738_ESCAPE_NOPERCENT Ignore the escaping delimiter '%'.
