/* Parse S into tokens separated by characters in DELIM.
   If S is NULL, the saved pointer in SAVE_PTR is used as
   the next starting point.  For example:
	char s[] = "-abc-=-def";
	char *sp;
	x = strtok_r(s, "-", &sp);	// x = "abc", sp = "=-def"
	x = strtok_r(NULL, "-=", &sp);	// x = "def", sp = NULL
	x = strtok_r(NULL, "=", &sp);	// x = NULL
		// s = "abc\0-def\0"

   This is a variant of strtok() that is multithread-safe.

   For the POSIX documentation for this function, see:

   Caveat: It modifies the original string.
   Caveat: These functions cannot be used on constant strings.
   Caveat: The identity of the delimiting character is lost.
   Caveat: It doesn't work with multibyte strings unless all of the delimiter
           characters are ASCII characters < 0x30.
