# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security-related reports are considered for official numbered releases
starting with v3.5. However, issues that do not affect the current Stable or
Beta series are unlikely to be fixed. Please see
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/ for the list of releases that belong to
the current series.

Reports about security issues in the Development series are welcomed. However,
development series contains experimental code that does not qualify for CVE
allocation.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report security-sensitive bugs, please post to the squid-bugs mailing
(list)[http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html#squid-bugs]. It
is a closed list (although anyone can post), and security related bug reports
are treated in confidence at least until the impact has been established.

The security team strives to manually acknowledge each new report within 48
hours. Please feel free to email a reminder if you have not heard from us
within that time frame.

As a _last_ resort (e.g., if the squid-bugs contact point appears to be
broken), contact the release maintainer directly. The maintainer is on the
security team but may not be able to respond promptly.


### Encrypted reports

Reporters wishing to encrypt their vulnerability reports can request GPG
public keys from the security team members via the squid-bugs mailing list.
Please note that encrypting reports may slow down their handling and is
unlikely to improve the overall security of the process.
