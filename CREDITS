This file contains copyright and licensing information for 3rd party software
imported into Squid. Squid software itself is copyrighted by The Squid
Software Foundation and contributors. Please see the COPYING and CONTRIBUTORS
files for details.

==============================================================================
Squid is derived from the ``cached'' software developed by the ARPA-funded
research project called The Harvest Information Discovery and Access System:

/*
 * Copyright (c) 1994, 1995.  All rights reserved.
 *  
 *   The Harvest software was developed by the Internet Research Task
 *   Force Research Group on Resource Discovery (IRTF-RD):
 *  
 *         Mic Bowman of Transarc Corporation.
 *         Peter Danzig of the University of Southern California.
 *         Darren R. Hardy of the University of Colorado at Boulder.
 *         Udi Manber of the University of Arizona.
 *         Michael F. Schwartz of the University of Colorado at Boulder.
 *         Duane Wessels of the University of Colorado at Boulder.
 *  
 *   This copyright notice applies to software in the Harvest
 *   ``src/'' directory only.  Users should consult the individual
 *   copyright notices in the ``components/'' subdirectories for
 *   copyright information about other software bundled with the
 *   Harvest source code distribution.
 *  
 * TERMS OF USE
 *   
 *   The Harvest software may be used and re-distributed without
 *   charge, provided that the software origin and research team are
 *   cited in any use of the system.  Most commonly this is
 *   accomplished by including a link to the Harvest Home Page
 *   (http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/) from the query page of any
 *   Broker you deploy, as well as in the query result pages.  These
 *   links are generated automatically by the standard Broker
 *   software distribution.
 *   
 *   The Harvest software is provided ``as is'', without express or
 *   implied warranty, and with no support nor obligation to assist
 *   in its use, correction, modification or enhancement.  We assume
 *   no liability with respect to the infringement of copyrights,
 *   trade secrets, or any patents, and are not responsible for
 *   consequential damages.  Proper use of the Harvest software is
 *   entirely the responsibility of the user.
 *  
 * DERIVATIVE WORKS
 *  
 *   Users may make derivative works from the Harvest software, subject 
 *   to the following constraints:
 *  
 *     - You must include the above copyright notice and these 
 *       accompanying paragraphs in all forms of derivative works, 
 *       and any documentation and other materials related to such 
 *       distribution and use acknowledge that the software was 
 *       developed at the above institutions.
 *  
 *     - You must notify IRTF-RD regarding your distribution of 
 *       the derivative work.
 *  
 *     - You must clearly notify users that your are distributing 
 *       a modified version and not the original Harvest software.
 *  
 *     - Any derivative product is also subject to these copyright 
 *       and use restrictions.
 *  
 *   Note that the Harvest software is NOT in the public domain.  We
 *   retain copyright, as specified above.
 *  
 * HISTORY OF FREE SOFTWARE STATUS
 *  
 *   Originally we required sites to license the software in cases
 *   where they were going to build commercial products/services
 *   around Harvest.  In June 1995 we changed this policy.  We now
 *   allow people to use the core Harvest software (the code found in
 *   the Harvest ``src/'' directory) for free.  We made this change
 *   in the interest of encouraging the widest possible deployment of
 *   the technology.  The Harvest software is really a reference
 *   implementation of a set of protocols and formats, some of which
 *   we intend to standardize.  We encourage commercial
 *   re-implementations of code complying to this set of standards.
