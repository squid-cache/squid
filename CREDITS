SQUID Internet Object Cache  http://www.squid-cache.org

Squid is derived from the ``cached'' software from the ARPA-funded
Harvest research project.  The Harvest home page is
http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/.

Squid is originally derived from the Harvest Information Discovery and
Access System.  The Harvest copyright text follows to acknowledge the origin:


/*
 * Copyright (c) 1994, 1995.  All rights reserved.
 *  
 *   The Harvest software was developed by the Internet Research Task
 *   Force Research Group on Resource Discovery (IRTF-RD):
 *  
 *         Mic Bowman of Transarc Corporation.
 *         Peter Danzig of the University of Southern California.
 *         Darren R. Hardy of the University of Colorado at Boulder.
 *         Udi Manber of the University of Arizona.
 *         Michael F. Schwartz of the University of Colorado at Boulder.
 *         Duane Wessels of the University of Colorado at Boulder.
 *  
 *   This copyright notice applies to software in the Harvest
 *   ``src/'' directory only.  Users should consult the individual
 *   copyright notices in the ``components/'' subdirectories for
 *   copyright information about other software bundled with the
 *   Harvest source code distribution.
 *  
 * TERMS OF USE
 *   
 *   The Harvest software may be used and re-distributed without
 *   charge, provided that the software origin and research team are
 *   cited in any use of the system.  Most commonly this is
 *   accomplished by including a link to the Harvest Home Page
 *   (http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/) from the query page of any
 *   Broker you deploy, as well as in the query result pages.  These
 *   links are generated automatically by the standard Broker
 *   software distribution.
 *   
 *   The Harvest software is provided ``as is'', without express or
 *   implied warranty, and with no support nor obligation to assist
 *   in its use, correction, modification or enhancement.  We assume
 *   no liability with respect to the infringement of copyrights,
 *   trade secrets, or any patents, and are not responsible for
 *   consequential damages.  Proper use of the Harvest software is
 *   entirely the responsibility of the user.
 *  
 * DERIVATIVE WORKS
 *  
 *   Users may make derivative works from the Harvest software, subject 
 *   to the following constraints:
 *  
 *     - You must include the above copyright notice and these 
 *       accompanying paragraphs in all forms of derivative works, 
 *       and any documentation and other materials related to such 
 *       distribution and use acknowledge that the software was 
 *       developed at the above institutions.
 *  
 *     - You must notify IRTF-RD regarding your distribution of 
 *       the derivative work.
 *  
 *     - You must clearly notify users that your are distributing 
 *       a modified version and not the original Harvest software.
 *  
 *     - Any derivative product is also subject to these copyright 
 *       and use restrictions.
 *  
 *   Note that the Harvest software is NOT in the public domain.  We
 *   retain copyright, as specified above.
 *  
 * HISTORY OF FREE SOFTWARE STATUS
 *  
 *   Originally we required sites to license the software in cases
 *   where they were going to build commercial products/services
 *   around Harvest.  In June 1995 we changed this policy.  We now
 *   allow people to use the core Harvest software (the code found in
 *   the Harvest ``src/'' directory) for free.  We made this change
 *   in the interest of encouraging the widest possible deployment of
 *   the technology.  The Harvest software is really a reference
 *   implementation of a set of protocols and formats, some of which
 *   we intend to standardize.  We encourage commercial
 *   re-implementations of code complying to this set of standards.

lib/md5.c:

/*
 * This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
 * The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was

 * This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
 *
 * Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
 * This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
 * except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
 * with every copy.
 *
 * To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
 * SquidMD5Context structure, pass it to SquidMD5Init, call
 * SquidMD5Update as needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call
 * SquidMD5Final, which will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the
 * digest.
 *
 * Changed so as no longer to depend on Colin Plumb's `usual.h' header
 * definitions; now uses stuff from dpkg's config.h.
 *  - Ian Jackson <ian@chiark.greenend.org.uk>.
 * Still in the public domain.
 *
 * Changed SquidMD5Update to take a void * for easier use and some
 * other minor cleanup. - Henrik Nordstrom <henrik@henriknordstrom.net>.
 * Still in the public domain.
 *
 * Prefixed all symbols with "Squid" so they don't collide with
 * other libraries.  Duane Wessels <wessels@squid-cache.org>.
 * Still in the public domain.
