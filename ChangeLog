	- Fixed some problems related to disk (and pipe) write error
	  handling.  file_close() doesn't always close the file
	  immediately; i.e. when there are pending buffers to write.
	  StoreEntry->lock_count could become zero while a write is
	  pending, then bad things happen during the callback.
	- The file_write() callback data must now be in the callback
	  database (cbdata).  We now use the swapout_ctrl_t structure
	  for the callback data; it stays around for as long as we are
	  swapping out.
	- Changed the way write errors are handled by diskHandleWrite.
	  If there is no callback function, now we exit with a fatal
	  message under the assumption that the file in question is a
	  log file or IPC pipe.  Otherwise, we flush all the pending
	  write buffers (so we don't see multiple repeated write errors
	  from the same descriptor) and let the upper layer decide how
	  to handle the failure.
	- Fixed storeDirWriteCleanLogs.  A write failure was leaving
	  some empty swap.state files, even though it tells us that its
	  "not replacing the file."  Don't flush/rename logs which we
	  have prematurely closed due to write failures, indiciated by
	  fd[dirn] == -1.  Close these files LAST, not before
	  renaming.
	- Fixed storeDirClean to clean directories in a more sensible
	  order, instead of the new "MONOTONIC" order for swap files.
	- Merged fdstat.c functions into fd.c.
	- Cleaned up some debugging sections.  Some unrelated source
	  files were using the same section.
	- Removed curly brackets from all cachemgr output.
	- Removed unused filemap->last_file_number_allocated member.
	- Removed unused fde->lifetime_data member.
	- Fixed incorrectly applying htonl() on icp_common_t->shostid.
	- Call setsid() before exec() in ipc.c so that child processes
	  don't receive SIGINT (etc) when running squid on a tty.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta14 (Feb 6, 1998):

	- Replaced snmplib free() calls with xfree().
	- Changed the 'net_db_name' hash table structure to
	  make it easier to move names from one network to another
	  (copied from 1.1 code).
	- Filled in some of the config dump routines (dump_acl,
	  dump_acl_access).
	- Full memory debugging option (--enable-xmalloc-debug-trace)
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Filled-in and clarified many squid.conf comments (Oskar
	  Pearson).
	- Fixed up handling of SWAP_LOG_DEL swap.state entries.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta13 (Feb 4, 1998):

	- NOTE: With this version the "swap.state" file format has
	  changed.  Running this version for the first time will
	  cause your current cache contents to be lost!
	- NOTE: this version still has the bug where we don't rewind
	  a swapout file and rewrite the swap meta data.  Objects
	  larger than 8KB will be lost when rebuilding from the swap
	  files.
	- Combined various interprocess communication setup functions
	  into ipcCreate().
	- Removed some leftover ICP_HIT_OBJ things.
	- Removed cacheinfo and proto_count() and friends; these are to
	  be replaced in functionality by StatCounters and 5/60 minute
	  average views via cachemgr.
	- Fixed --enable-acltree configure message (Masashi Fujita).
	- Fixed no reference to @LIB_MALLOC@ in src/Makefile.in
	  (Masashi Fujita).
	- Fixed building outside of source tree (Masashi Fujita).
	- FTP: Format NLST listings, and inform the user that the NLST
	  (plain) format is available when we find a LIST listing that we
	  don't understand (Henrik Nordstrom)
	- FTP: Use SIZE on Binary transfers, and not ASCII. The
	  condition was inversed, making squid use SIZE on ASCII
	  transfers (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Enable virtual and Host: based acceleration in order to be
	  able to use Squid as a transparent proxy without breaking
	  either virtual servers or clients not sending Host: header
	  the order of the virtual and Host: based acceleration needs
	  to be swapped, giving Host: a higher precendence than virtual
	  host (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Use memmove/bcopy as detected by configure Some systems does
	  not have memmove, but have the older bcopy implementation
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Completely rewritten aiops.c that creates and manages a pool
	  of threads so thread creation overhead is eliminated (SLF).
	- Lots of mods to store.c to detect and cancel outstanding
	  ASYNC ops.  Code is not proven exhaustive and there are
	  definately still cases to be found where outstanding disk ops
	  aren't cancelled properly (SLF).
	- Changes to call interface to a few routines to support disk
	  op `tagging', so operations can be cleanly cancelled on
	  store_abort()s (SLF).
	- Implementation of swap.state files as transaction logs.
	  Removed objects are now noted with a negative object size.
	  This allows reliatively clean rebuilds from non-clean
	  shutdowns (SLF).
	- Now that the swap.state files are transaction logs, there's
	  now no need to validate by stat()ing.  All the validation
	  procedure does is now just set the valid bit AFTER all the
	  swap.state files have been read, because by that time, only
	  valid objects can be left.  Object still need to be marked
	  invalid when reading the swap.state file because there's no
	  guarantee the file has been retaken or deleted (SLF).
	- An fstat() call is now added after every
	  storeSwapInFileOpened() so object sizes can be checked.   Added
	  code to storeRelease() the object if the sizes don't match (SLF).
        - #defining USE_ASYNC_IO now uses the async unlink() rather than
          unlinkd() (SLF).
	- #defining MONOTONIC_STORE will support the creation of disk
	  objects clustered into directories.  This GREATLY improves disk
	  performance (factor of 3) over old `write-over-old-object'
	  method.  If using the MONOTONIC_STORE, the
	  {get/put}_unusedFileno stack stuff is disabled.  This is
	  actually a good thing and greatly reduces the risk of serving
	  up bad objects (SLF).
	- Fixed unlink() in storeWriteCleanLogs to be real unlink()
	  rather than ASYNC/unlinkd unlinks.  swap.state.new files were
	  being removed just after they were created due to delayed
	  unlinks (SLF).
	- Disabled various assertions and made these into debug warning
	  messages to make the code more stable until the bugs can be
	  tracked down (SLF).
	- Added most of Michael O'Reilly's patches which included many
	  bug fixes.  Ask him for full details (SLF).
	- Moved aio_check_callbacks in comm_{poll|select}().  It was
	  called after the fdset had been built which was wrong because
	  the callbacks were changing the state of the read/write
	  handlers prior to the poll/select() calls (SLF).
	- Fixed ARP ACL memory leaks (Dale).
	- Eliminated URL and SHA cache keys.  Cache keys will always
	  be MD5's now.
	- Fixed up store swap meta data.
	- Changed swap.state logs to a binary format.
	- The swap.state logs are written transaction-style.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta12 (Jan 30, 1998):

	- Added metadata headers to cache swap files.  This is an
	  incompatible change with previous versions.  Running this
	  version for the first time will cause your current cache
	  contents to be lost.
	- -D_REENTRANT when linking with -lpthreads (Henrik Nordstrom)
	- Show symlink destinations as a hyperlink in FTP listings
	  (Henrik Nordstrom)
	- Fixed not allocating enough space for rewriting URLs with
	  the Host: header (Eric Stern).
	- Year-2000 fixes (Arjan de Vet).
	- Fixed looping for cache hits on HEAD requests.
	- Fixed parseHttpRequest() coredump for 
          "GET http://foo HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Changes to squid-1.2.beta11 (Jan 6, 1998):

	- Fixed fake 'struct rusage' definition which prevented compling
	  on Solaris 2.4.
	- Fixed copy-by-ref bug for request->headers in
	  clientRedirectDone() (Michael O'Reilly).
	- Workaround for Solaris pthreads closing FD 0 upon fork()
	  (Michael O'Reilly).
	- Fixed shutdown bug with outgoing UDP sockets; we need to
	  disable their read handlers.
	- For comm_poll(), use the fast 50 msec timeout only when
	  USE_ASYNC_IO is defined.
	- Fixed pointer bug when freeing AS# ACL entries.
	- Fixed forgetting to reset Config.npeers to zero in free_peer().
	- Fixed ICP bug causing excessive TIMEOUTs with sibling
	  neighbors.  We must call the ICP reply callback even for
	  sibling misses.
	- Fixed some dnsserver-related reconfigure bugs. Need to 
	  use cbdataLock, etc in fqdncache.c.  Also don't want to
	  use ipcacheQueueDrain() and fqdncacheQueueDrain().
	- Fixed persistent connection bug.  We were incorrectly
	  deciding that non-200 replies without content-length
	  would not have a reply body.
	- Fixed intAverage() precedence bug.
	- Fixed memmove() 'len' arg bug.
	- Changed algorithm for determining alive/dead state of peers.
	  Instead of using a fixed number of unacknowledged ICP
	  replies, it is now based on timeouts.  If there are no ICP
	  replies received from a peer within 'dead_peer_timeout'
	  seconds, then we call it dead.
	- Added calls to getCurrentTime() in
	  comm_{select,poll}_incoming() when ALARM_UPDATES_TIME is not
	  being used.
	- Fixed shutdown bug when the incoming and outgoing ICP socket
	  is the same file descriptor.
	- Added buffered writes for storeWriteCleanLogs() (Stewart
	  Forster).
	- Patches for Qnx4 (Jean-Claude MICHOT).
	- Fixed returning void functions which seems to be a GCC-ism.
	- New configure script options (Henrik Nordstrom):
		--enable-new-storekey=[sha|md5(|url)] (was --enable-hashkey)
		--enable-acltree
		--enable-icmp
		--enable-delay-hack
		--enable-useragent-log
		--enable-kill-parent  (this should be named -hack)
		--enable-snmp
		--enable-time-hack
		--enable-cachemgr-hostname[=hostname]   (new)
		--enable-arp-acl  (new)
	- Added Doug Lea malloc-2.6.4 to the distribution, so that
	  people easily can try a decent malloc package if they syspect
	  their malloc is broken.  --enable-dlmalloc (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Made XMALLOC_DEBUG_COUNT working again. Requires a small stub
	  function (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Removed top-level Makefile.  People must now run 'configure'
	  before 'make'.
	- Fixed checkFailureRatio() implementation.
	- Made 'squid -z' behave like the 1.1 version.


Changes to squid-1.2.beta10 (Jan 1, 1998):

	- Fixed content-length bugs for 204 replies, 304 replies,
	  and HEAD requests (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed errorAppendEntry() bug in gopherReadReply().
	- Basic support for FTP URL typecodes (;type=X).
	- Support for access controls based on ethernet MAC addresses
	  (Dale).
	- Initial URN support; see
	  http://squid.nlanr.net/Squid/urn-support.html
	- Fixed client-side persistent connections for objects with
	  bad content lengths (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed bad call to storeDirUpdateSwapSize() for objects which
	  never reach SWAPOUT_DONE state.
	- Fixed up poll() #defines in squid.h (Stewart Forster).
	- Changed poll() timeout from 1000 msec to 50 msec for
	  better performance under low load (Stewart Forster).
	- Changed storeWriteCleanLogs() to write objects in the LRU
	  list order instead of the random hash table order.
	- Fixed FTP bug when data socket connections fail or timeout.
	- Reuse FTP data connection when possible (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Added configure options (Henrik Nordstrom)
		--enable-store-key=sha|md5
		--enable-xmalloc-statistics
		--enable-xmalloc-debug
		--enable-xmalloc-debug-count 
		--async-io 
	- Fixed confusing with the use/meaning of ERR_CANNOT_FORWARD
	  by creating ERR_FORWARDING_DENIED and changing the
	  content of the ERR_CANNOT_FORWARD text.
	- Fixed pipeline request bug from using strdup() (Henrik
	  Nordstrom).
	- Call clientReadRequest() directly instead of commSetSelect()
	  for pipelined requests (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed 4k page leak in icpHandleIMSReply();
	- Renamed 'icp*' functions to 'client*' names in client_side.c.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta8 (Dec 2, 1997):

	- Fixed accessLogLog() to log ident from Proxy-Authorization
	  request header (BoB Miorelli).
	- Fixed #includes, prototypes, etc. in SNMP source files.
	- Moved 'POLLRDNORM' and 'POLLWRNORM' macro checks from
	  include/config.h.in to src/squid.h
	- Moved 'num32' typedefs from src/typedefs.h to
	  include/config.h.in.
	- Moved snmplib/md5.c to lib/md5.c.
	- Added MD5 cache key support.
	- Removed xmalloc() return check in uudeocde.c
	- Added 'ifdef' support to cf_gen.c for optional code (e.g. SNMP)
	- Changed 'client' program to provide easier cache manager access,
	  e.g.:	'client mgr:info'
	- Fixed 'client' to send 'Connection' instead of 'Proxy-Connection'
	  for simulated keep-alive requests.
	- Removed 'fd' arg from clientProcess* functions.
	- Fixed bugs from using errorSend() on persistent/pipelined
	  client connections.  A latter request should not be allowed to
	  write to the client fd until the current request completes.
	  Now use errorAppendEntry() for such situations.
	- Fixed content-length bugs.  We were using content-length == 0
	  to also indicate a lack of content-length reply header.  But
	  'content-length: 0' might appear in a reply, so now use -1 to
	  indicate that no content length given.
	- Split up clientProcessRequest() into smaller chunks so it
	  might be easier to follow.
	- renamed various client_side.c functions to start with 'client'
	  instead of 'icp'.
	- Fixed a 'cbdata leak' from the comm.c close handlers.
	- Fixed a 'cbdata leak' from the comm.c connect routines.
	- Fixed comm_select() and comm_poll() to stop looping on the
	  incoming HTTP/ICP sockets.  If there are fewer than 7 FD's
	  ready for I/O, the incoming sockets might not get service, so
	  comm_select() would be called for up to 7 times until the
	  'incoming_counter' was incremented enough to trigger a call
	  to comm_select_incoming().  Now we make sure
	  comm_select_incoming() gets called if select returns less
	  than 7 ready FD's.
	- Added errorpage '%B' token to generate FTP URLs with a '%2f'
	  inserted at the start of the url-path.  calls ftpUrlWith2f().
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Changed fqdncache.c to use LRU double-linked list instead of qsort()
	  for replacement and cachemgr output.
	- Changed ipcache.c to use LRU double-linked list instead of qsort()
	- Changed hash_insert() and hash_join() to return void.
	  for replacement and cachemgr output.
	- Moved StoreEntry->method member to MemObject->method.
	- Made StoreEntry->flags 16 bits.
	- Made StoreEntry->refcount 16 bits.
	- Changed URL-based public cache key to always include the request
	  method.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta7 (Nov 24, 1997):

	- Fixed poll() for Linux (David Luyer).
	- SHA optimizations (David Luyer).
	- Fixed errno clashes with macro on Linux (David Luyer).
	- Fixed storeDirCloseSwapLogs(); logs might not be open.
	- Fixed storeClientCopy2() bug.  Detect when there is
	  no more data to send for objects in STORE_OK state.
	- Fixed FTP truncation bug when ftpState->size == 0, e.g.
	  especially directory listings.
	- Mega FTP fix from Henrik Nordstrom.  A better job of
	  implementing the '%2f' hack.
	- Fixed some pipelined request bugs.  storeClientCopy() was
	  being given the wrong StoreEntry, and we had a race condition
	  which is now handled by storeClientCopyPending().
	- Added initial SNMP support.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta6 (Nov 13, 1997):

	- Fixed Authorized responses getting swapped out when they
	  don't have Proxy-Revalidate reply header.
	- Fixed Proxy Authentication support.  We never sent back
	  a 407 reply, and were incorrectly incrementing the passwd
	  before comparing it.
	- Fixed stat()ing pathnames for default values before parsing
	  config file (Ron Gomes).
	- Fixed logging request and response headers on separate lines
	  (Ron Gomes).
	- Fixed FTP Authentication message (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Changed Proxy Authentication to trigger a reread of the passwd
	  file if a password check fails (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Changed FTP to retry the first CWD with a leading slash if it
	  fails without one.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta5 (Nov 6, 1997):

	- Track the 'keep-alive ratio' for a peer as the ratio of
	  the number of replies including 'Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive'
	  compared to the number of requests sent.  If the peer does
	  not support Persistent connections then this ratio will tend
	  toward zero.  If the ratio is less than 50% after 10 requests
	  then we'll stop sending Keep-Alive.
	- Proper support for %nn escapes in FTP, and numerous
	  other fixes (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Support for Secure Hash Algorithm and framework for other
	  hash functions as cache keys.
	- Fixed SSL snprintf() bug which broke SSL proxying.
	- Fixed store_dir swap log bug from reconfigure (SIGHUP).
	- Fixed LRU Reference Age bug.  The arg to pow() must be
	  minutes, not seconds.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta4 (Oct 30, 1997):

	- Fixed DST bug in rfc1123.c
	- Changed default http_accel_port to 80.
	- added errorCon() as a ErrorState constructor function
	  (Max Okumoto).
	- Added ERR_FTP_FAILURE message for ftpFail().
	- For FTP, the timeout callback must be moved to the 'data'
	  descriptor when data transfer begins.  Otherwise we are
	  likely to get a timeout on the control descriptor.
	- Fixed double-free bug in httpRequestFree().
	- Fixed store_swap_size counting bug in storeSwapOutHandle().

Changes to squid-1.2.beta3 (Oct 29, 1997):

	- Initialize _res.options to RES_DEFAULT in dnsserver.c.
	- Fix assertions which assumed 4-byte pointers.
	- Fix missing % in fqdncache.c snprintf().
	
Changes to squid-1.2.beta2 (Oct 28, 1997):

	- Fixed aiops.c and async_io.c so that they actually compile
	  with USE_ASYNC_IO (Arjan de Vet).
	- Fixed errState->errno causing problems with some macros
	  (Michael O'Reilly).
	- Fixed memory leaks in pconn.c (Max Okumoto).
	- Enhanced 'client' program with 'ping' behaviour (Ron Gomes).
	- Fixed InvokeHandlers() from calling memCopy() for ALL
	  store_client's with callbacks.  A store_client might be reading
	  from disk.
	- Rewrote storeMaintainSwapSpace().  No longer will we scan one
	  bucket at a time.  Instead we'll maintain a single LRU
	  list.  When an object is 'touched' we move it to the
	  top of this list.  When we need disk space, we delete
	  from the bottom.
	- Removed storeGetSwapSpace().
	
Changes to squid-1.2.beta1 ():

	- Reworked storage manager to not keep objects in memory during
	  transit.  In other words, no separate NOVM distribution.
	- Lots of cleanup and debugging for beta release.
	- Use snprintf() everywhere instead of sprintf().
	- The 'in_memory' hash table has been replaced with a
	  doubly-linked list.  New objects are added to the head of
	  the list.  When memory space is needed, old objects are
	  purged from the tail of the list.

Changes to squid-1.2.alpha7 ():

	- fixes fixes fixes.
	- Made Arjan's PROXY_AUTH ACL patch standard.

Changes to squid-1.2.alpha6 ():

	- Simpler cacheobj implementation.
	- persistent connection histogram
	- SERVER-SIDE PERSISTENT CONNECTIONS:
        	- Added pconn.c 
        	- Addec Cofig.Timeout.pconn; default 120 seconds
        	- Added httpState->flags
        	- Added flags arg to httpBuildRequestHeader()
        	- Added HTTP_PROXYING and HTTP_KEEPALIVE flags
        	- Added 'Connection' to allowed HTTP headers (http-anon.c)
		- Added 'Proxy-Connection' to allowed HTTP headers
		  (http-anon.c)
		- Merged proxyhttpStart() with httpStart() and created
		  new httpBuildState().
		- New httpPconnTransferDone() detects end-of-data on
		  persistent connections.

Changes to squid-1.2.alpha5 ():

	- New configuration system.  Everything is generated from
	  'cf.data.pre', including the main parser, setting defaults,
	  outputting current values, and freeing memory.  
	  This also involved moving some of the local data structures
	  (e.g. struct _acl *AclList in acl.c) to the Config
	  structure.  (Max Okumoto)
	- No more '/i' for regular expressions.  Now insert a '-i'
	  to switch to case-insensitive.  Use '+i' for case-sensitive.
	- When you have a variable named the same as its type, sizeof()
	  gets the wrong one (fde).
	- Need to flush unbuffered logs before fork().
	- Added two fields swap log: refcount and e->flag.
	- Removed all the .h files for each .c file.  Now #include stuff
	  is in either: defines.h, enums.h, typedefs.h, structs.h,
	  or protos.h, globals.h.  This greatly reduces dependencies
	  between the various source files.
	- globals.c is generated from globals.h by a Perl script.
	- Started customizable error texts.

Changes to squid-1.2.alpha4 ():

	- New MIME configuration, regular expression based
	- Added request_timeout config option
	- Multiple HTTP sockets (Lincoln Dale).
	- Moved 'fds_are_n_free' check to httpAccept().
	- s/USE_POLL/HAVE_POLL/; make poll() default if available.
	- Changed storeRegister to use offsets and make immediate
	  callbacks if appropriate.
	- Removed icpDetectClientClose().  Some of that functionality
	  goes into clientReadRequest() and the rest into
	  httpRequestFree().
	- Moved IP lookups to commConnect stuff.
	- Added support for retrying connect().
	- New inline debug() macro (David Luyer).
	- Replace frequent gettimeofday() calls with alarm(3) based
	  clock.  Need to add more gettimeofday() calls to get back
	  high-resolution timestamp logging (Andres Kroonmaa).
	- Added support for Cache-control: proxy-revalidate;
	  based on squid-1.1 patch from Mike Mitchell.

Changes to squid-1.2.alpha3 ():

	- Implemented persistent connections between clients and squid.
	- Moved various FD tables (comm.c, fdstat.c, disk.c) to a single
	  table in fd.c.
	- Removed use of FD as an identifier in certain callback
	  operations (ipcache, fqdncache).
	- General code cleanup.
	- Fixed typedefs for callback functions.
	- Removed FD lifetime/timeout dichotomy.  Now we only have
	  timeouts, however the lifetime concept/keyword may still
	  linger in certain places.
	- Change Makefile 'realclean' target to 'distclean'
	- Changed config file parsing of time specifications to use
	  parseTimeLine().
	- Removed storetoString.c

Changes to squid-1.2.alpha2 ():

	- Merged squid-1.1.9, squid-1.1.10 changes

Changes to squid-1.2.alpha1 ():

	- Unified peer selection algorithm.
	- aiops.c and aiops.h are a threaded implementation of
	  asynchronous file operations (Stewart Forster).
	- async_io.c and async_io.h are complete rewrites of the old
	  versions (Stewart Forster).
	- Rewrote all disk file operations of squid to support
	  the idea of callbacks except where not required (Stewart
	  Forster).
	- Background validation of 'tainted' swap log entries (Stewart
	  Forster).
	- Modified storeWriteCleanLog to create the log file using the
	  open/write rather than fopen/printf (Stewart Forster).
	- Added the EINTR error response to handle badly interrupted
	  system calls (Stewart Forster).
	- UDP_HIT_OBJ not supported, removed.
	- Different sized 'cache_dirs' supported.

==============================================================================

Changes to squid-1.1.14 (July 11, 1997):

	- Another try at log_url crap.  Added icpState->log_url
	  member.  Set mem_obj->log_url in new_MemObject() which
	  means passing more args to storeCreateEntry().  Also added
	  urlClean() which calls urlParse(); needed for ICP logging.
	- Clean URLs will be truncated at '?' if present.
	- Give fd_note() the clean URL.

Changes to squid-1.1.13 (July 9, 1997):

	- Fixed storeLog() coredump on mem->log_url.
	- Fixed string bounds bug if a redirector returns a short
	  hostname which require appending 'append_domain' (David
	  Lamkin).
	- Added 'fake_user_agent' to configuration because HTTP
	  anonymizing strips the User-Agent which some servers require.

Changes to squid-1.1.12 (July 5, 1997):

	- Fixed dnsserver buffer overflow bug and other problems related
	  to long, bogus domain names.
	- Fixed occasional incorrect ERR_DNS_FAIL errors caused when
	  an IP cache entry gets released about the same time an
	  ICP query timeout occurs.
	- Fixed setrlimit() bugs seen on DUNIX 4.0; rl.rlim_max == 0.
	- Only strip 'Proxy-authorization' header when USE_PROXY_AUTH
	  is defined and proxy_auth is configured (Ron Gomes).
	- Added missing calls to reset socket timeouts for SSL
	  and passthrough requests.
	- Fixed "Available number of file descriptors" value in
	  cachemgr info output.
	- Fixed coredump in proxyAuthenticate() if password file
	  has an entry with only a user name (Jordan Hrycaj).
	- Security patch for usernames and passwords in URLs.
	  + ftpget would insert a BASE URL including the username and
	    password for directory listings IF the original request did
	    NOT include the the trailing slash.  This could be disabled
	    with a command line option, but is enabled by default.  Now
	    its #ifdefd out.
	  + Usernames and passwords could be logged to access.log and
	    store.log.  Now a new element,
	    StoreEntry->MemObject->log_url, holds a copy of the requested
	    URL without the name and password.  This isn't 100% fixed yet
	    because log_url gets generated when the StoreEntry gets
	    created.  If the StoreEntry never gets created, then the URL
	    with name and password will get logged.  Also, the name and
	    password are not stripped from ICP requests.  Also, this
	    changes store.log.  Previously we logged StoreEntry->key
	    which would look different than the URL for private entries,
	    but now we'll always log the URL.
	  + Finally, we now set REQ_AUTH for any request that includes a
	    name or password.  This prevents the request from being
	    cached (!) and prevents it from being sent to neighbor
	    caches.  In other words, its treated just as if an
	    Authorization request header were present.
	- Fixed Byte-Range handling so that valid, whole objects
	  are not released.

	  water mark.
	- Fixed storeCheckExpired() to not always check the

	  entry.
	- With ENTRY_DISPATCHED now fixed, call squid_error_entry()
	  from protoUnregister() for StoreEntries which have not
	  been dispatched.
	- Fixed 'quick_abort' parsing bug.

	- quick_abort actually works now
	- quick_abort functionality made conditional
	- ttl_pattern storage wasn't being cleaned upon a reread of

	  sure the entire request is read.

Changes to squid-1.0.beta1 (Apr 19, 1996) from Harvest cached-1.4.pl3:

	- Added a "server mode" to ftpget.  Now the (much smaller)
	  ftpget process forks for each FTP request.
	- Added support for If-Modified-Since GET requests.
	- Added support for SSL and https objects.
	- Added background processing for rebuilding the disk store
	  while serving requests.  Cache can now serve requests immediately.
	- Added a 'reconfigure' feature activated by SIGHUP.  The config
	  file is re-read and most changes will take effect.
	- Added an internal flag for using private keys with ICP queries
	  to neighbors.  If any neighbor returns a reqnum field of zero,
	  then disable using private keys.  But still use private
	  keys for things with bypass the ICP query step (such as POST
	  and IMS-GET).
	- Added a function to verify content-lengths.  Objects with
	  mismatched (but non-zero) content lenghts will be ejected.
	- Added clean shutdown mode.  On SIGTERM the incoming HTTP socket
	  is closed.  Active clients are given a lifetime of 30 seconds
	  (configurable).  Process exits when all sockets are closed.
	- Added support for large POST objects.
	- Added "store.log" which logs RELEASE/SWAPIN/SWAPOUT events.
	- Added announce feature to squid; no longer external program.
	  If enabled, a running cache will announce itself every 24 hrs.
	- Added support for FTP URLs with non-default ports.
	- Added new Access Control List scheme.
	- Added Forwarded: header to proxy HTTP requests (HTTP/1.1 feature).
	- Added weights neighbors.

	- Added 'pid_filename' to configuration file.
	- Added 'visible_hostname' to configuration file.
	- added 'ftp_user' to configuration file.
	- added 'dns_positive_ttl' to configuration file.
	- added 'dns_negative_ttl' to configuration file.
	- Added 'shutdown_lifetime' to configuration file.
	- Fixed bug where cache process would "spin" on large objects
	  being deferred.
	- Fixed byte order conversion bug on setting echo port.
	- Changed meaning of command line -b (buffered logs) option.
	  Now the default behaviour is unbuffered logs, use -b to make
	  them buffered.
	- Changed WAIS code to always be fully compiled in.
	- Changed the storage manager to use the notion of private and
	  public keys.  Requests are now private until the reply headers
	  have been read.
	- Changed access logging significantly.  Entries to "access.log"
	  are written when the client connection closes.  Every connection
	  is logged exactly once, always with a valid size.
	- Changed access log format (non-common) to include request
	  method and sub-second timestamps.
	- Changed handing of ECONNRESET (connection reset) errors.
	  Now treated like any other read error.
	- Changed 'rotate logs' to be activated by SIGUSR1.
	- Changed configure script to look specifically for tm_gmtoff
	  and set HAVE_TM_GMTOFF.
	- Changed configure script to look specifically extended mallinfo
	  structure and set HAVE_EXT_MALLINFO
	- Changed ICP reply code to use negative TTL value as UDP_HIT
	  threshold so we never return a HIT on neg-cached objects.
	- Changed ftpget to use select(2) on I/O for timeouts.  ftpget
	  now exits immediately if stdin goes away.
	- Changed handling of '-z' option.  Now only execute 'rm -rf ...' if
	  -U option also given.
	- Removed the command line -d (debug) option.  Use 'debug_options'
	  in config file.
	- Removed all code and references to binary port.
	- Removed dual logging to stderr/cache.log.
	- Removed old IP access controls ('proxy_allow', etc.)
