Older ChangeLog follows. The sections relating to Squid-2.6 is not entirely
authorative for this release and mirrored here for reference only.

	- CARP now plays well with the other peering algorithms,
	  and support for CARP peerings is compiled by default. Can be
	  disabled by --disable-carp
	- Configuration file can be read from an external program
	  or preprocessor. See squid.8 man page.
	- http_port is now optional, allowing for SSL only operation
	- Satellite and other high latency peering relations enhancements
	  (Robert Cohren)
	- Nuked num32 types, and made type detection more robust by the
	  use of typedefs rather than #defines.
	- the mailto links on Squid's ERR pages now contain data about the
	  occurred error by default, so that the email will contain this data in
	  its body. This feature can be disabled via the email_err_data directive.
	  (Clemens L?ser)
	- COSS now uses a file called stripe and the path in squid.conf is the
	  directory this is placed in. Additionally squid -z will create the
	  COSS swapfile.

	- HTCP support for access control and the CRL operation for
	  purgeing of cache content

Changes to squid-2.5.STABLE2 (Mars 17, 2003):

	- Contrib files added back to the distribution
	- Several compiler warnings fixed when using --disable-ident or
	  --disable-http-violations
	- authentication can now be used in most access controls, but
	  must in most cases first be enforced in http_access to force
	  the user to authenticate.
	- cleanups in the developer bootstrap.sh process when preparing
	  the sources.
	- several squid.conf.default documentation updated to correctly
	  refer to the current names when refering to other directives
	- authenticate_ip_ttl documentation updates
	- several assertion faults and segmentation violations corrected
	- the RunCache/RunAccel and squid.rc scripts updated to refer to
	  the squid binary in sbin rather than the old bin location.
	- squid_ldap_auth command line processing fixes when specifying
	  the LDAP server last on the line instead of -h option
	- aufs data corruption bugfix
	- aufs performance improvement for low traffic systems
	- aufs stability improvements
	- external_acl corrected to properly deal with quoted strings
	- WCCPv1 bugfix to make sure the router accepts the hash assignments
	- "Total accounted memory" now correctly reported in cachemgr
	- several small memory leaks (mostly reconfigure related)
	- new squid.conf option to allow GET/HEAD requests with a request
	  entity
	- "make uninstall" no longer removes squid.conf
	- cachemgr.cgi now uses POST to avoid having the cachemgr password
	  logged in the web server logs
	- authentication schemes which are known to not be proxyable are now
	  filtered out from forwarded server replies to avoid that the clients
	  tries to use such schemes when we know for a fact it won't work
	- spelling corrections in various error messages
	- now possible to define acl values with spaces in them
	  by using the "include file" feature
	- squid_ldap_group updated to 2.10 to fix compilation issues with
	  recent (and older) OpenLDAP libraries and to make the helper deal
	  correctly with true LDAP groups by first looking up the user DN.
	- Some internal code cleanups
	- now verifies that programs etc exists iside the chroot directory
	  when using chroot_dir. No longer neccesary to set up a split view
	  environment where the same paths works both inside the chroot and
	  outside just to convince Squid that the files is actually there..
	- improved memory usage reporting
	- --disable-hostname-checks configure option
	- no longer ignores double dots in host names. Any hostname with
	  double dots is now rejected as invalid.
	- log_mime_hdrs no longer logs garbage if very long headers
	  are seen.
	- 'select_fds_hist' object added to cachemgr 'histogram' output
	- pid file now unlinked when squid has really shut down, not
	  immediately when the shutdown request is received. This allows
	  the pid file to be monitored to determine when Squid has shut down
	  properly
	- correct authentication scheme setups on some platforms or compilers
	- several squid.conf.default documentation updates to remove references
	  to renamed or replaced directives by changing them to their current
	  names.
	- the SSL reverse proxy support updated to allow building with
	  OpenSSL 0.9.7 and and later.
	- Corrected a minor performance problem while processing HEAD replies
	  from various broken web servers not sending a correct HTTP reply
	- time acls can now specify multiple times in the same acl name, like
	  most other acl types.
	- winbind helpers updated to match Samba-2.2.7a and should
	  work with Samba-2.2.6 or later (required). For compability with
	  older Samba versions A new configure option --with-samba-sources=...
	  has been added to allow you to specify which Samba version the
	  helpers should be built for if different than the above versions.
	- Squid MIB definition syntax correction to work better with newer
	  (and older) SNMP tools.
	- Fixed access.log format when logging "error:invalid-HTTP-ident" on
	  requests where parsing the HTTP identifier (HTTP/1.0) failed.
	- "make distclean" no longer removes the icons, this avoids the
	  dependency on "uudecode" to rebuild Squid after "make distclean"
	- User name returned by external acl lookups (external_acl_type)
	  is now available as "ident" in later acl checks in addition to
	  the logging in access.log.
	- Incorrect behaviour of Digest authentication partly corrected - it
	  will not handle sessions, but will always enforce password
	  correctness.. (patch submitted by Sean Burford).
	- Issue with persistent connections and PUT/POST request corrected
	  
Changes to squid-2.5.STABLE1 (September 25, 2002):

	- Major rewrite of proxy authentication to support other schemes
	  than basic. First in the line is NTLM support but others can
	  easily be added (minimal digest is present). See Programmers Guide.
	  (Robert Collins & Francesco Chemolli)
	- Reworked how request bodies are passed down to the protocols.
	  Now all client side processing is inside client_side.c, and
	  the pass and pump modules is no longer used.
	  used by Squid.
	- Optimized searching in proxy_auth and ident ACL types. Squid should
	  now handle large access lists a lot more efficiently.
	  (Francesco Chemolli)
	- Fixed forwarding/peer loop detection code (Brian Degenhardt) -
	  now a peer is ignored if it turns out to be us, rather than
	  committing suicide
	- Changed the internal URL code to obey appendDomain for internal
	  objects if it needs appending. This fixes weirdnesses where
	  a machine can think it is "foo.bar.com", and "foo" is requested.
	  (Brian Degenhardt)
	- Added the use of Automake to create the Makefile.in's in the squid
	  source tree. This will allow libtool in the future, and immediately
	  allows better dependency tracking - with or without gcc - as well
	  as the dist-all and distcheck targets for developers which respectively
	  build a tar.gz and a tar.bz2 distribution, and check that what will be
	  distributed builds.
	- Added TOS and source address selection based on ACLs,
	  written by Roger Venning. This allows administrators to set
	  the TOS precedence bits and/or the source IP from a set of
	  available IPs based upon some ACLs, generally to map different
	  users to different outgoing links and traffic profiles.
	- Added 'max-conn' option to 'cache_peer'
	- Added SSL gatewaying support, allowing Squid to act as a SSL server
	  in accelerator setups.
	- SASL authentication helper by Ian Castle
	- msntauth updated to v2.0.3
	- no_cache now applies to cache hits as well as cache misses
	- the Gopher client in Squid has been significantly improved
	- Squid now sanity checks FTP data connections to ensure the
	  connection is from the requested server. Can be disabled if
	  needed by turning off the ftp_sanitycheck option.
	- external acl support. A mechanism where flexible ACL checks
	  can be driven by external helpers. See the external_acl_type
	  and acl external directives.
	- Countless other small things and fixes
	- HTML pages generated by Squid or CacheMgr as well as the
	  ERR documents now contain a doctype declaration so that
	  browsers know which HTML specification the document uses.
	  In addition to that they have a new look (background-color, font)
	  and are valid according to the HTML standards at www.w3.org.
	  (Clemens L ser)
	- Login and password send to Basic auth helpers is now URL escaped
	  to allow for spaces and other "odd" characters in logins and
	  passwords
	- Proxy Authentication is no longer blindly forwarded to peer
	  caches if not used locally. If forwarding of proxy authentication
	  is desired then it must now be configured with the login=PASS
	  cache_peer option.
	- Responses with Vary: in the header are now cached by squid.
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Removed unused 'siteselect_timeout' directive.

Changes to Squid-2.4.STABLE7 (July 2, 2002):

	- Squid now drops any requests using transfer-encoding.
	  Squid is a HTTP/1.0 proxy and as such do not support
	  the use of transfer-encoding.
	- The MSNT auth helper has been updated to v2.0.3+fixes for
	  buffer overflow security issues found in this helper.
	- A security issue in how Squid forwards proxy authentication
	  credentials has been fixed
	- Minor changes to support Apple MAC OS X and some other platforms
	  more easily.
	- The client -T option has been implemented
	- HTCP related bugfixes in "squid -k reconfigure"
	- Several bugfixes and cleanup of the Gopher client, both
	  to correct some security issues and to make Squid properly
	  render certain Gopher menus.
	- FTP data channels are now sanity checked to match the address of
	  the requested FTP server. This to prevent theft or injection of
	  data. See the new ftp_sanitycheck directive if this is not desired.
	- Security fixes in how Squid parses FTP directory listings into HTML

Changes to Squid-2.4.STABLE6 (March 19, 2002):

	- The patch for 2.4.STABLE5 was insufficiently tested and
	  introduced a bug that causes frequent assertions when
	  handling DNS PTR answers.

Changes to Squid-2.4.STABLE5 (March 15, 2002):

	- Fixed an array bounds bug in lib/rfc1035.c.  This bug
	  could allow a malicious DNS server to send bogus replies
	  and corrupt the heap memory.

Changes to Squid-2.4.STABLE4 (Feb 19, 2002)

	- htcp_port 0 now properly disables htcp
	- Fixed problem with certain non-anonymous ftp:// style URL's
	- SNMP bugfixes including several memory leaks

Changes to Squid-2.4.STABLE3 (Nov 28, 2001):

	- Fixed bug #255: core dump on SSL/CONNECT if access denied by
	  miss_access
	- Fixed bug #246: corrupt on-disk meta information preventing
	  rebuilds of lost swap.state files
	- Fixed bug #243: squid_ldap_auth now supports spaces in passwords
	- Fixed a coredump when creating FTP directories
	- Fixed a compile time problem with statHistDump prototype mistmatch,
	  reported by some compilers
	- Fixed a potential coredump situation on snmpwalk in certain
	  configurations
	- Fixed bug #229: filedescriptor leakage in the "aufs" cache_dir
	  store implementation
	- Serbian error message translations

Changes to Squid-2.4.STABLE2 (Aug 24, 2001):

	- Expanded configure's GCC optimization disabling check to
	  include GCC 2.95.3
	- avoid negative served_date in storeTimestampsSet().
	- Made 'diskd' pathnames more configurable
	- Make sure squid parent dies if child is killed with
	  KILL signal
	- Changed diskd offset args to off_t instead of int
	- Fixed bugs #102, #101, #205: various problems with useragent
	  log files
	- Fixed bug #116: Large Age: values still cause problems
	- Fixed bug #119: Floating point exception in
	  storeDirUpdateSwapSize()
	- Fixed bug #114: usernames not logged with
	  authenticate_ip_ttl_is_strict
	- Fixed bug #115: squid eating up resources (eventAdd args)
	- Fixed bug #125: garbage HTCP requests cause assertion
	- Fixed bug #134: 'virtual port' support ignores
	  httpd_accel_port, causes a loop in httpd_accel mode
	- Fixed bug #135: assertion failed: logfile.c:135: "lf->offset
	  <= lf->bufsz"
	- Fixed bug #137: Ranges on misses are over-done
	- Fixed bug #160: referer_log doesn't seem to work
	- Fixed bug #162: some memory leaks (SNMP, delay_pools,
	  comm_dns_incoming histogram)
	- Fixed bug #165: "Store Mem Buffer" leaks badly
	- Fixed bug #172: Ident Based ACLs fail when applied to
	  cache_peer_access
	- Fixed bug #177: LinuxPPC 2000 segfault bug due to varargs abuse
	- Fixed bug #182: 'config' cachemgr option dumps core with
	  null storage
	- Fixed bug #185: storeDiskdDirParseQ[12]() use wrong number
	  of args in debug/printf
	- Fixed bug #187: bugs in lib/base64.c
	- Fixed bug #184: storeDiskdShmGet() assertion; changed
	  diskd to use bitmap instead of linked list
	- Fixed bug #194: Compilation fails on index() on some
	  non-BSD platforms
	- Fixed bug #197: refreshIsCachable() incorrectly checks
	  entry->mem_obj->reply
	- Fixed bug #215: NULL pointer access for proxy requests
	  in accel-only mode

Changes to Squid-2.4.STABLE1 (Mar 20, 2001):

	- Fixed a bug in and cleaned up class 2/3 delay pools
	  incrementing.
	- Fixed a coredump bug when using external dnsservers that
	  become overloaded.
	- Fixed some NULL pointer bugs for NULL storage system
	  when reconfiguring.
	- Fixed a bug with useragent logging that caused Squid to
	  think the logfile never got opened.
	- Fixed a compiling bug with --disable-unlinkd.
	- Changed src/squid.h to always use O_NONBLOCK on Solaris
	  if it is defined.
	- Fixed a bug with signed/unsigned bitfield flag variables
	  that caused problems on Solaris.
	- Fixed a bug in clientBuildReplyHeader() that could add
	  an Age: header with a negative value, causing an assertion
	  later.
	- Fixed an SNMP reporting bug.   cacheCurrentResFileDescrCnt
	  was returning the number of FDs in use, rather than
	  the number of reserved FDs.
	- Added the 'pipeline_prefetch' configuration option.
	- cache_dir syntax changed to use options instead of many
	  arguments. This means that the max_objsize argument now
	  is an optional option, and that the syntax for how to
	  specify the diskd magics is slightly different.
	- Various fixes for CYGWIN
	- Upgraded MSNT auth module to version 2.0.
	- Fixed potential problems with HTML by making sure all
	  HTML output is properly encoded.
	- Fixed a memory initialization problem with resource records in
	  lib/rfc1035.c.
	- Rewrote date parsing in lib/rfc1123.c and made it a little
	  more lenient.
	- Added Cache-control: max-stale support.
	- Fixed 'range_offset_limit' again.  The problem this time
	  is that client_side.c wouldn't set the we_dont_do_ranges
	  flag for normal cache misses.  It was only being set for
	  requests that might have been hits, but we decided to
	  change to a miss.
	- Added the Authenticate-Info and Proxy-Authenticate-Info
	  headers from RFC 2617.
	- HTTP header lines longer than 64K could cause an assertion.
	  Now they get ignored.
	- Fixed an IP address scanning bug that caused "123.foo.com"
	  to be interpreted as an IP address.
	- Converted many structure allocations to use mem pools.
	- Changed proxy authentication to strip leading whitespace
	  from usernames after decoding.
	- Prevented NULL pointer access in aclMatchAcl().  Some
	  ACL types require checklist->request_t, but it won't be
	  available in some cases (like snmp_access).  Warn the
	  admin that the ACL can't be checked and that we're denying
	  it.
	- Allow zero-size disk caches.
	- The actual filesystem blocksize is now used to account
	  for space overheads when calculating on-disk cache size.
	- Made the maximum memory cache object size configurable.
	- Added 'minimum_direct_rtt' configuration option.
	- Added 'ie_refresh' configuration option, which is a hack
	  to turn IMS requests into no-cache requests.
	- Added support for netfilter in linux-2.4. This allows transparent
	  proxy connections to function correctly in the absence of a Host:
	  header. This requires --enable-linux-netfilter to be passed through
	  to configure. (Evan Jones)
	- Fixed a bug with clientAccessCheck() that allowed proxy
	  requests in accel mode.
	- Fixed a bug with 301/302 replies from redirectors.  Now
	  we force them to be cache misses.
	- Accommodated changes to the IP-Filter ioctl() interface
	  for intercepted connections.
	- Fixed handling of client lifetime timeouts.
	- Fixed a buffer overflow bug with internal DNS replies
	  by truncating received packets to 512 bytes, as per
	  RFC 1035.
	- Added "forward.log" support, but its work in progress.
	- Rewrote much of the IP and FQDN cache implementation.
	  This change gets rid of pending hits.
	- Changed peerWouldBePinged() to return false if our 
	  ICP/HTCP port is zero (i.e. disabled).
	- Changed src/net_db.c to use src/logfile.c routines,
	  rather than stdio, because of solaris stdio filedescriptor
	  limits.
	- Made netdbReloadState() more robust in case of corrupted
	  data.
	- Rewrote some freshness/staleness functions in src/refresh.c,
	  partially inspired to support cache-control max-stale.
	- Fixed status code logging for SSL/CONNECT requests.
	- Added a hack to subtract cache digest network traffic
	  from statistics so that byte hit ratio stays positive
	  and more closely reflects what people expect it to be.
	- Fixed a bug with storeCheckTooSmall() that caused
	  internal icons and cache digests to always be released.
	- Added statfs(2) support for displaying actual filesystem
	  usage in the cache manager 'storedir' output.
	- Changed status reporting for storage rebuilding.  Now it
	  prints percentage complete instead of number of entries
	  parsed.
	- Use mkstemp() rather than problem-prone tempnam().
	- Changed urlParse() to condense multiple dots in hostnames.
	- Major rewrite of async-io (src/fs/aufs) to make it behave
	  a bit more sane with substantially less overhead.  Some
	  tuning work still remains to make it perform optimal.
	  See the start of store_asyncufs.h for all the knobs.
	- Fixed storage FS modules to use individual swap space 
	  high/low values rather than the global ones.
	- Fixed storage FS bugs with calling file_map_bit_reset()
	  before checking the bit value.  Calling with an invalid
	  value caused memory corruption in random places.
	- Prevent NULL pointer access in store_repl_lru.c for
	  entries that exist in the hash but not the LRU list.

Changes to Squid-2.4.DEVEL4 ():

	- Added --enable-auth-modules=... configure option
	- Improved ICP dead peer detection to also work when the workload
	  is low
	- Improved TCP dead peer detection and recovery
	- Squid is now a bit more persistent in trying to find a alive
	  parent when never_direct is used.
	- nonhierarchical_direct squid.conf directive to make non-ICP
	  peer selection behave a bit more like ICP selection with respect
	  to hierarchy.
	- Bugfix where netdb selection could override never_direct
	- ICP timeout selection now prefers to use parents only when
	  calculating the dynamic timeout to compensate for common RTT
	  differences between parents and siblings.
	- No longer starts to swap out objects which are known to be above
	  the maximum allowed size.
	- allow-miss cache_peer option disabling the use of "only-if-cached".
	  Meant to be used in conjunction with icp_hit_stale.
	- Delay pools tuned to allow large initial pool values
	- cachemgr filesystem space information changed to show useable space
	  rather than raw space, and platform support somewhat extended.
	- Logs destination IP in the hierarchy log tag when going direct.
	  (can be disabled by turning log_ip_on_direct off)
	- Async-IO on linux now makes proper use of mutexes. This fixes some
	  odd pthread segfaults on SMP Linux machines, at a slight performance
	  penalty.
	- %s can now be used in cache_swap_log and will be substituted with
	  the last path component of cache_dir.
	- no_cache is now a full ACL check without, allowing most ACL types
	  to be used.
	- The CONNECT method now obeys miss_access requirements
	- proxy_auth_regex and ident_regex ACL types
	- Fixed a StoreEntry memory leak during "dirty" rebuild
	- Helper processes no longer hold unrelated filedescriptors open
	- Helpers are now restarted when the logs are rotated
	- Negatively cached DNS entries are now purged on "reload".
	- PURGE now also purges the DNS cache
	- HEAD on FTP objects no longer retrieves the whole object
	- More cleanups of the dstdomain ACL type
	- Squid no longer tries to do Range internally if it is not supported
	  by the origin server. Doing so could cause bandwidth spikes and/or
	  negative hit ratio.
	- httpd_accel_single_host squid.conf directive
	- "round-robin" cache_peer counters are reset every 5 minutes to
	  compensate previously dead peers
	- DNS retransmit parameters
	- Show all FTP server messages
	- squid.conf.default now indicates if a directive isn't enabled in
	  the installed binary, and what configure option to use for enabling it
	- Fixed a temporary memory leak on persistent POSTs
	- Fixed a temporary memory leak when the server response headers
	  includes NULL characters
	- authenticate_ip_ttl_is_strict squid.conf option
	- req_mime_type ACL type
	- A reworked storage system that supports storage directories in
	  a more modular fashion. The object replacement and IO is now
	  responsibility of the storage directory, and not of the storage
	  manager.
	- Fixed a bogus MD5 mismatch warning sometimes seen when using
	  aufs or diskd stores
	- Added --enable-stacktraces configure option to set PRINT_STACK_TRACE,
	  and extended support for this to Linux/GNU libc.
	- Disabled the "request timeout" error message sent if the user agent
	  did not provide a request in a timely manner after opening the
	  connection. Now the connection is silently closed. The error message
	  was confusing user agents utilizing persistent connections.
	- Fixed configure --enable descriptions to match the arg names.
	- Eliminated compile warnings from auth_modules/MSNT code.
	- Require first character of hostnames to be alphanumeric.
	- Made ARP ACL work for Solaris.
	- Removed storeClientListSearch().
	- Added counters to track diskd operation success and
	  failures.
	- Fixed range_offset_limit.
	- Added code to retry ServFail replies for internal DNS
	  lookups.
	- Added referer header logging (Jens-S. Voeckler).
	- Added "multi-domain-NTLM" authentication module, a Perl
	  script from Thomas Jarosch.
	- Added configurable warning messages for high memory usage,
	  high response time, and high page faults.
	- Made store dir selection algorithm configurable.
	- Added support for admin-definable extension methods,
	  up to 20.
	- Added 'maximum_object_size_in_memory' as a configuration option -
	  this defines the watermark where objects transit from being true
	  hot objects to being in-transit objects in memory. It currently
	  defaults to 8 KB.
	- Change to the fqdn code which changes how pending DNS requests
	  are treated as private and only become public once they are
	  completed. This can add extra load on DNS servers but prevents
	  all the pending clients blocking if one of the queries got
	  stuck. (Duane Wessels)
	- Converted more code to use MemPools, from Andres Kroonmaa.
	- Added more CYGWIN patches from Robert Collins.

Changes to Squid-2.4.DEVEL3 ():

	- Added Logfile module.
	- Added DISKD stats via cachemgr.
	- Added squid.conf options for DISKD magic constants.

Changes to Squid-2.4.DEVEL2 (Feb 29, 2000):

Changes to Squid-2.4.DEVEL1 ():

Changes to Squid-2.3.STABLE4 (July 18, 2000):

	- Fixed --localstatedir configure option (IKEDA Shigeru).
	- Fixed IPFilter headers on OpenBSD (Nic Bellamy, Brad
	  Smith).
	- Added pthread_sigmask() check to configure (Daniel
	  Ehrlich).
	- Added CYGWIN patches from Robert Collins.
	- Changed internal DNS lookups to retry queries that are
	  returned with RCODE 2 (ServFail).
	- Added 'virtual port' support (Gregg Kellogg).  If
	  'httpd_accel_uses_host_header' is enabled, then we use
	  the port number from the Host header.  Otherwise, when
	  'httpd_accel_port' is set to "0" we use the port number
	  of the local end of the client socket.
	- Fixed a typo in carp.c (Nikolaj Yourgandjiev).
	- Made Squid accept GET requests that have a "content-length:
	  0" header.
	- Added a sanity check on the NHttpSockets[] array index
	  (Gregg Kellogg).
	- Added a friendlier message when Squid can't find any DNS
	  nameserver addresses to use (Daniel Kiracofe).
	- Added nonstandard WEBDAV methods: BMOVE, BDELETE, BPROPFIND
	  (Craig Whitmore).
	- Added missing '%c' token replacement in error page
	  generation.
	- Fixed a bug with 'minimum_object_size' that prevented
	  internal icons from being loaded.
	- Fixed "extra semicolon" bug in storeExpiredReferenceAge()
	  that could prevent any objects from being replaced.
	- Make sure that storeDirDiskFull() doesn't actually
	  *increase* the cache size.
	- Changed a storeSwapMetaUnpack() assertion to a recoverable
	  error condition.
	- Removed "wccpHereIam" event check that could cause Squid
	  to stop sending HERE_I_AM messages.

Changes to Squid-2.3.STABLE3 (May 15, 2000):

	- Fixed malloc linking problems on Solaris.  The configure
	  script incorrectly set options for dlmalloc.
	- Added a configure check to remove compiler optimization
	  for GCC 2.95.x.
	- Updated MSNT authenticator module.
	- Updated Estonian error pages.
	- Updated Japanese error pages.
	- Fixed expires bug in httpReplyHdrCacheInit.  It was
	  incorrectly setting expires based on max-age.  It was using
	  the current time as a basis, instead of the response date.
	- Fixed "USE_DNSSERVER" typos.
	- Added a workaround for getpwnam() problems on Solaris.
	  getpwnam() could fail if there are fewer than 256 FDs
	  available.  This causes root to own some disk files.
	- Added an 'offline_toggle' option via the cache manager.
	- Added a 'minimum_object_size' option.  Files smaller than
	  this size are not stored.
	- Added 'passive_ftp' option to disable passive FTP transfers.
	- Added 'wccp_version' option because some Cisco IOS versions
	  require WCCP version 3.
	- The 'client' program in ping mode (-g) now prints transfer
	  throughput.
	- Fixed logging of proxy auth username for redirected
	  requests.
	- Fixed bogus Age values for IMS requests.
	- Fixed persistent connection timeout for client-side
	  connections.  It was hard-coded to 15 seconds, now uses
	  the 'pconn_timeout' value.
	- Fixed up httpAcceptDefer.  It wasn't being used properly
	  and caused high CPU usage when Squid gets close to the FD
	  limit.
	- Numerous delay_pools fixes and checks.
	- Fixed SNMP coredumps from running snmpwalk.
	- Added a check for errno == EPIPE in icmp.c when pinger uses
	  a Unix socket instead of a UDP socket.
	- Fixed ACL checklist memory initialization bugs.
	- Cleaned up the MIB file.  Replaced contact information and
	  checked description fields.
	- Removed LRU reference_age hard-coded upper limit.
	- Fixed async I/O FD leak.
	- Made getMyHostname() more robust.
	- Fixed domain list matching bug.  "x-foo.com" wasn't properly
	  compared to ".foo.com" and confused splay tree ordering.
	- Added a check for whitespace in hostnames and optionally
	  strip whitespace if 'uri_whitespace' setting allows.
	- Added status code and checking to ASN/whois queries.

Changes to Squid-2.3.STABLE2 (Mar 2, 2000):

	- Changed Copyright text.
	- Changed configure so that some IRIX-6.4 hacks apply to
	  all IRIX-6.* versions.
	- Cleaned up HTML bugs in error pages.
	- Told configure to check for netinet/if_ether.h, which
	  is used in ARP ACL code, but might not be required.
	- Added "Cookie" to known HTTP headers so it can be
	  used in anonymizer configuration.
	- Added optional TCP_REDIRECT log code for logging
	  of 301/302 responses returned by Squid.
	- Added a check for a currently running Squid process.
	  If the pid file exists, and the pid is running,
	  Squid complains and refuses to start another instance.
	- Changed async I/O scope to PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS for
	  IRIX.
	- Fixed a bug with the PURGE method.  The purge enable
	  flag was not getting cleared during reconfigure.
	  Also required PURGE method to be used in http_access
	  list before enabling.
	- Fixed async I/O assertions for file open errors.
	- Fixed internal DNS assertion when unpacking truncated
	  messages.
	- Fixed anonymize_headers bug that caused all headers
	  to be allowed after a reconfigure.
	- Fixed an access denied bug for accelerator-only installations.
	- Fixed internal DNS initialization so that it uses
	  'dns_nameservers' settings in squid.conf if set.
	- Fixed 'maxconn' ACL bug that caused it to work backwards
	  (Pedro Ribeiro).
	- Fixed syslog bug for daemon mode on Linux.
	- Fixed 'http_port' parsing bugs.
	- Fixed internal DNS byte ordering bugs for PTR queries.
	- Fixed internal DNS queue getting stuck during periods
	  of low activity (Henrik).
	- Fixed byte ordering bugs for parsing EPLF FTP listings
	  on 64-bit systems.
	- Fixed 'request_body_max_size' bug that caused all
	  POST, PUT requests to be denied if max size is set
	  to zero.
	- Fixed 'redirector_access' bug when using 'myport' ACLs.
	- Fixed CARP neighbor selection bugs for down peers.
	- Added 'client_persistent_connections' and
	  'server_persistent_connections' flags to disable persistent
	  connections for clients and servers.
	- Fixed access logging bug that caused many requests to be
	  logged as TCP_MISS.
	- Added some bounds checking to delay pools code.

Changes to Squid-2.3.STABLE1 (Jan 9, 2000):

	- Updated PAM authentication module from Henrik Nordstrom.
	- Updated Bulgarian error messages from Svetlin Simeonov.
	- Changed ACL routines so that User-Agent (browser) string
	  is always taken from compiled HTTP request headers
	  instead of passed as an argument to aclCreateChecklist.
	- Added a 'strip' option to the 'uri_whitesace' configuration
	  directive and made it the default behavior.  Whitespace
	  found in URI's is now stripped out by default.
	- Added chroot feature.  The 'chroot_dir' config option enables
	  it and specifies the directory.
	- Changed clientBuildReplyHeader so that the Age header is
	  added only for cache hits, and only when we can calculate
	  a valid, positive age value.
	- Changed clientWriteComplete and clientGotNotEnough so
	  that they keep persistent connections open for more types
	  of replies that don't have bodies.
	- Changed filemap.c routines to dynamically grow filemap
	  space as needed.
	- Added a hack to ftp.c to deal with ftp.netscape.com, which
	  sometimes doesn't acknowledge PASV commands.
	- Fixed FTP bug with ftpScheduleReadControlReply; there
	  was not always a timeout handler on the control socket
	  after the transfer completed.
	- Fixed FTP filedescriptor leak from invalid PASV replies.
	- Changed httpBuildRequestHeader so that it doesn't
	  copy the Host header from the client request.  Instead
	  we should generate our own Host header which is known
	  to be correct.
	- Changed storeTimestampsSet to adjust entry->timestamp
	  if the response includes an Age header.
	- Removed size limit from storeKeyHashBuckets.
	- Changed fwdConnectStart from a "heavy" to a "light" event.
	- Fixed an 'anonymize_headers' bug that affects unknown
	  HTTP headers.  With the bug, if you list a header that
	  Squid doesn't know about (such as "Charset"), it would
	  add HDR_OTHER to the allow/deny mask.  This caused all
	  unknown headers to be allowed or denied (depending on
	  the scheme you use).  Now, with the bug fixed, an unknown
	  header in the 'anonymize_headers' list is simply ignored.

Changes to Squid-2.3.DEVEL3 ():

	- Added MSNT auth module from Antonino Iannella.
	- Added --enable-underscores configure option.  This allows
	  Squid to accept hostnames with underscores in them.  Your
	  DNS resolver may still complain about them, however.
	- Added --heap-replacement configure option.  This enables
	  the alternative cache replacement policies, such as
	  GDSF, and LFUDA.
	- WCCP establishes and registers with the router faster.        
	- Added 'maxconn' acl type to limit the number of established
	  connections from a single client IP address.  Submitted
	  by Vadim Kolontsov.
	- Close FTP data socket as soon as transfer completes
	  (Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	- Fixed ftpReadPass() to not clobber ctrl.message when
	  the PASS command fails.
	- Added a redirect.c patch so squidGuard is able to do
	  per-user access control (Antony T Curtis).
	- discard the pumpMethod() function, and instead use the
	  fact that the request has a request entity (content-length
	  present) (Henrik).
	- Reload the MIME icons at reconfigure time (Radu Greab).
	- Updated Richard Huveneers' SMB authentication module to
	  his version 0.05 package.
	- Fixed lib/heap.c::heap_delete() bug when deleting the
	  last node.
	- Fixed an integer conversion bug in
	  lib/rfc1035.c::rfc1035AnswersUnpack().
	- Fixed lib/rfc1738 routines to encode reserved characters,
	  in addition to encoding the unsafe characters (Henrik).
	- Changed the interface for splay compare and "walk"
	  functions to take a void pointer, instead of a splayNode
	  pointer (Henrik).
	- Changed numerous HTTP parsing routines to use ssize_t
	  instead of size_t.  This was done because size_t may be
	  signed or unsigned.  When it is unsigned, gcc emits
	  numerous "comparison is always true" warnings.  At least
	  we know ssize_t is always signed.
	- Fixed src/HttpHeaderTools::httpHeaderHasConnDir() and
	  friends so that it properly handles multi-value lists.
	- Added an "end" (ssize_t) parameter to
	  src/HttpReply::httpReplyParse() so that we know exactly
	  where to terminate the header buffer.
	- Changed src/access_log.c::log_quote() so that it only
	  encodes whitespace characters, and not all URL-special
	  characters (Henrik).
	- Added local port ACL type ("myport") (Henrik).
	- Added maximum number of connections per client ("maxconn")
	  as an ACL type.
	- Fixed proxy authentication username/password parsing to
	  be more robust (Henrik).
	- Fixed ACL domain/host and domain/domain comparison
	  functions yet again.  Eliminated duplicate code so that
	  only src/url.c::matchDomainName() contains this mysterious
	  code.
	- Changed the 'http_port' option to accept an IP address
	  or hostname as well (Henrik).
	- Removed 'tcp_incoming_addr' option.
	- Added an access control list for the redirector
	  ('redirector_access').  Requests which match are sent to
	  the redirector.  All requests. are redirected by default.
	- Added the 'authenticate_ip_ttl' option.  It specifies
	  how long a valid proxy authentication credential is
	  bound to a specific address.
	- Added 280, 488, 591, and 777 to "Safe_ports" ACL.
	- Removed the unused and highly questionable 'forward_snmpd_port'
	  option.
	- Added an option to accept DNS messages from unknown nameservers.
	  This may be necessary if replies come from a different address
	  than queries are sent to.
	- Added #includes for IP Filter files in netinet directory.
	- Fixed a bug with retrying forwarded IMS requests (Henrik).
	- Fixed a bug in src/client_side.c::clientInterpretRequestHeaders()
	  where we were checking a cache-control bit before getting the
	  mask from the HTTP headers (pallo@initio.no).
	- Fixed a bug with "no_cache" access list.  If not defined,
	  everything was uncachable by default.
	- Fixed a bug with timed-out client-side HTTP connections.
	  We didn't cancel the read handler, which could lead to 
	  "rwstate != NULL" warnings.
	- Changed comm_open() to only call fdAdjustReserved() for
	  specific errors (ENFILE, EMFILE);
	- Fixed NULL pointer bug in idnsParseResolvConf().
	- Split CACHE_DIGEST_HIT into CD_PARENT_HIT and CD_SIBLING_HIT.
	- Added DELETE request method.
	- Added RFC 2518 HTTP status codes.
	- Fixed handling of URL passwords when we need to rewrite a
	  BASE HREF URL (Henrik).
	- Fixed a bug with FTP requests where a request gets aborted,
	  but we try to complete it anyway.  It would result in a
	  "store_status != STORE_PENDING" assertion.  The solution
	  is to check for ENTRY_ABORTED before reading from
	  the control channel too.
	- Changed FTP to retry a request if Squid fails to establish
	  a PASV data connection (Henrik).
	- Fixed numerous HTCP memory leaks and an uninitialized memory
	  bug.
	- Changed httpMaybeRemovePublic() with RFC 2518 and 2616 in
	  mind (Henrik).
	- Minor fixes for Rhapsody systems.
	- Define _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED in squid.h so that AIX systems
	  don't include varargs.h.
	- Changed src/store_client.c::storeClientType() so that
	  an entry can have more than one STORE_MEM_CLIENT.
	- Changed src/store_client.c::storeClientReadHeader()
	  to check swapfile metadata (Henrik).
	- Changed src/url.c::urlCheckRequest() to return FALSE for
	  any "https://" URL.  These should always be CONNECT
	  instead.  If Squid gets an "https://" URL, it is a browser
	  bug.
	- Added numerous squid.conf options for controlling cache
	  digests.   Previously these were hard-coded in
	  src/store_digest.c.  (Martin Hamilton)
	- Added 'cache_peer' option called 'digest-url' that
	  lets you specify the URL for a peer's digest.
	  (Martin Hamilton)
	- Added DELAY_POOLS hacks to scan "slow" connections in
	  a random order (David Luyer).
	- ARP_ACL fixes from Damien Miller.  Linux 2.2.x uses a
	  per-interface arp/neighbour cache, whereas 2.0.x uses a
	  unified cache. Under 2.2.x you are required to specify
	  a interface name when looking up ARP table entries with
	  SIOCGARP.
	- If the process umask is not set (i.e. 0), then Squid
	  changes it to 007.

Changes to Squid-2.3.DEVEL2 ():

	- Added --enable-truncate configure option.
	- Updated Czech error messages ()
	- Updated French error messages ()
	- Updated Spanish error messages ()
	- Added xrename() function for better debugging.
	- Disallow empty ("") password in aclDecodeProxyAuth()
	  (BoB Miorelli).
	- Fixed ACL SPLAY subdomain detection (again).
	- Increased default 'request_body_max_size' from 100KB
	  to 1MB in cf.data.pre.
	- Added 'content_length' member to request_t structure
	  so we don't have to use httpHdrGetInt() so often.
	- Fixed repeatedly calling memDataInit() for every reconfigure.
	- Cleaned up the case when fwdDispatch() cannot forward a
	  request.  Error messages used to report "[no URL]".
	- Added a check to return specific error messages for a
	  "store_digest" request when the digest entry doesn't exist
	  and we reach internalStart().
	- Changed the interface of storeSwapInStart() to avoid a bug
	  where we closed "sc->swapin_sio" but couldn't set the
	  pointer to NULL.
	- Changed storeDirClean() so that the rate it gets called
	  depends on the number of objects deleted.
	- Some WCCP fixes.
	- Added 'hostname_aliases' option to detect internal requests
	  (cache digests) when a cache has more than one hostname
	  in use.
	- Async I/O NUMTHREADS now configurable with --enable-async-io=N
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Added queue length to async I/O cachemgr stats (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Added OPTIONS request method.

Changes to Squid-2.3.DEVEL1 ():

	- Added WCCP support.  This adds the 'wccp_router' squid.conf
	  option.
	- Added internal DNS queries; Most installations can run
	  without the external dnsserver processes.
	- Rewrote much of the code that stores cache objects on
	  disk.  Developed a programming interface that should
	  allow new storage systems to be added easily.  This still
	  is pretty ugly and needs a lot of work, however.
	- Replaced async_io.c "tags" with callback data locks.
	  This probably breaks async IO in a bad way.
	- Tried to write an Async IO disk storage module.
	- Added code to replace the StoreEntry linked list with a
	  heap structure.  This allows for different replacement
	  algorithms, instead of being stuck with LRU.  This adds
	  the 'replacement_policy' squid.conf option. (John Dilley
	  et al).
	- Fixed HTCP queries by actually checking for freshness
	  based on the HTCP header fields.
	- Fixed passing of redirector command line arguments.
	- Added 'request_header_max_size' squid.conf option.
	- Added 'request_body_max_size' squid.conf option.
	- Added 'reply_body_max_size' squid.conf option.
	- Added 'peer_connect_timeout' squid.conf option.
	- Added 'redirector_bypass' squid.conf option.
	- Added RFC 2518 (WEBDAV) request methods.
	
Changes to Squid-2.2 (April 19, 1999):

	- Removed all SNMP specific ACL code
	  SNMP now uses generic squid ACL's
	- Removed view-based access crontrol
	- Cleaned up and simplified SNMP section of squid.conf
	- Changed the SNMP code to use a tree stucture.
	- Added objects to MIB: 
		Request Hit Ratio's
		Byte Hit Ratio's
		Number of Clients
	- Changed SNMP Agent to return object instances correctly.
	- Added our own assert() macro so we can use debug() instead of
	  printing to stderr.
	- Added eventFreeMemory().
	- Fixed ipcCreate() bug when debug_log has FD <= 2.
	- Changed watchChild() and related code in main.c so that
	  Squid can behave more like a proper daemon process.
	- Added 'prefer_direct' option (enabled by default) so that
	  people can give parents higher preference than direct.
	- Fixed ipc.c close() bug for async IO.  On FreeBSD,
	  comm_close() doesn't work for child processes when async IO is
	  used.
	- Fixed setting the public key for large ``icons'' (Henrik
	  Nordstrom).
	- Rewrote peer digest module to fix memory leaks on reconfigure
	  and clean the code. Increased "current" digest version to 5
	  ("required" version is still 3). Revised "Peer Select" cache 
	  manager stats.
	- Added "-k parse" command line option: parses the config file
	  but does not send a signal unlike other -k options.
	- Revamped storeAbort() calling.  Only store_client.c has all
	  the right information to determine if the request should
	  be aborted.  Now client and server modules just storeUnregister
	  without ever needing to call storeAbort.
	- Small change of Squid output for FTP (Andrew Filonov,
	  Henrik Nordstrom).
	- clientGetsOldEntry() sends old entry if new request status
	  is in the 500-range (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Changed configure so it works with IRIX6.4 C compiler (broken?)
	  option -OPT:fast_io=ON.
	- Fixed comm_connect_addr() non-blocking connections for
	  SONY NEWSOS (Makoto MATSUSHITA).
	- Changed "#ifdef __STDC__" to "#if STDC_HEADERS" as recommended
	  by autoconf documentation.
	- Fixed client-side cache-control max-age (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Added a new error page: ERR_SHUTTING_DOWN.  fwdStart() returns
	  this error if it is called while squid is in the process of
	  shutting down.
	- Added support for linuxthreads package under FreeBSD (Tony Finch).
	- Fixed HP-UX StatHist.c assertions by making the "hbase_f"
	  functions non-static (Michael Pelletier).
	- Fixed logging of authenticated usernames even if the
	  authorization is not cached (Dancer).
	- Fixed pconnPush() bug that prevented holding on to
	  persistent connections (Manfred Bathelt).
	- Pid file now rewritten on SIGHUP.
	- Numerous Ident changes:
		- Ident lookups will now be done on demand if you use the
		  'ident' ACL type.
		- The 'ident_lookup on|off' option has been replaced with
		  an access list, so you can do lookups only for some
		  client addresses.
		- Added an 'ident_timeout' option to specifiy the amount
		  of time to wait for an ident lookup.
	- Added a (local) hit rate to mempool metering.
	- FTP Restarts (REST command) is now supported.
	- Check for libintl.a on SCO3.2.
	- Disable poll() on SCO3.2.
	- Numerous Async IO enhancements from Henrik.
	- Removed cache_mem_low and cache_mem_high options (Henrik
	  Nordstrom).
	- Replaced 'persistent_client_posts' with 'broken_posts' access
	  list.
	- Rewrote the anonymizer.
	- Removed the http_anonymizer option.
	- Added the anonymize_headers option to allow individual
	  referencing of headers for addition or removal. See
	  'anonymize_headers' in squid.conf for additional
	  configuration.
	- Fixed config file parser's handing of optional directives.
	  Some people might get new warnings about unknown config
	  directives.
	- Added 'myip' ACL type.  This is the local IP address for
	  connected sockets (Luyer).
	- Fixed parsing of FTP DOS directory listings with spaces
	  (Nordstrom).
	- Numerous DELAY_POOL changes/fixes from David Luyer:
		- Makes no-delay neighbors for DELAY_POOLS work by
		  using a fd_set with the connections to no-delay
		  peers marked in it.
		- Makes IP addresses ending in 0 and 255, and
		  network number 255, work with individual and
		  network delay pools (they were previously not
		  permitted, and documented as such).
		- Massive overhaul of delay pools code - dynamically
		  allocated delay pools, as many as required.
		- delayPoolsUpdate stops running if DELAY_POOLS is
		  configured but no delay pools are configured.
		- Initial delay pool levels are now configurable
		  as a percentage of the maximum for the pool in
		  question (used to be all set to 1 second worth
		  of traffic).  Pools are restored to this level
		  on reconfiguratoin.
	- Changed storeClientCopy to give a swap-in failure if 
	  the number of open disk FD's is above the 'max_open_disk_fds'
	  limit.  Otherwise, a very loaded cache will end up with
	  all disk files open for reading, and none for writing.
	- Added lib/inet_ntoa.c from BSD Unix for systems that have
	  broken inet_ntoa().  (Erik Hofman).
	- Added more specific FTP error messages for "permission
	  denied, "file not found," and "service unavailable."
	  (Tony Finch)
	- Added xisspace(), xisdigit(), etc, macros to cast function
	  args and eliminate compiler warnings.
	- Fixed case-sensitive comparisons of domain names (Henrik
	  Nordstrom).
	- Added proxy-authentication to cachemgr.cgi's requests
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Changed Squid to *truncate* rather than *unlink* purged
	  swap files.  Can be reversed by undefining 
	  USE_TRUNCATE_NOT_UNLINK in src/defines.h.
	- Changed internal icon headers to use Cache-control
	  Max-age instead of Expires.
	- Changed storeMaintainSwapSpace behavior to be adjusted
	  smoothly, instead of discretely, between store_swap_low
	  and store_swap_high.  This includes the number of
	  objects to scan, number to remove, and time until the
	  next storeMaintainSwapSpace event.
	- Fixed a quick_abort bug that incorrectly calculated
	  content lengths.
	- Added getpwnam() auth module from Erik Hofman.
	- Added 'coredump_dir' option.
	- Fixed a peerDestroy() assertion that required peer->digest
	  to be NULL at the end of peerDestroy().
	- configure script now automatically enables dlmalloc for
	  Solaris/x86.
	- configure enables poll() on linux 2.2 and later (Henrik).
	- Icon files are now distributed in binary format, install
	  will not need to run 'sh' and 'uudecode'.
	- Fixed some bugs with large responses (>READ_AHEAD_GAP) and
	  re-forwarding requests and ENTRY_FWD_HDR_WAIT.
	  fwdCheckDeferRead() will NOT defer reading if the
	  ENTRY_FWD_HDR_WAIT bit is set.
	- Fixed a "F->flags.open" assertion for aborted FTP PUT's.
	- Fixed a (double) cast problem that caused statAvgTick()
	  events to be added as fast as possible.
	- Changed httpPacked304Reply() to not include the Content-Length
	  header for 304 replies that Squid generates.  We used to
	  include the length of the cached object, and this broke
	  persistent connections.

	2.2.STABLE2:

	- Fixed configure bug for statvfs() checks.  Configure reports
	  "test: =: unary operator expected" or similar because an
	  unquoted variable is not defined.
	- Fixed aclDestroyAcls() assertion because some ACL types
	  are not listed in the switch statement.  Occurs for
	  srcdom_regex and dstdom_regex ACL types during reconfigure.
	- Typo "applicatoin" in src/mime.conf
	- The unlinkd daemon never saw the USE_TRUNCATE_NOT_UNLINK
	  #define because it didn't include squid.h.
	- Fixed commRetryFD() when bind() fails.   commRetryFD was
	  closing the filedescriptor, but it is the upper layer's
	  job to close it.
	- Changed configure's "maximum number of filedescriptors"
	  detection to only use getrlimit() for Linux.  On AIX,
	  getrlimit returns RLIM_INFINITY.
	- Fixed snmpInit() nesting bug.
	- Fixed a bug with peerGetSomeParent().  It was adding
	  a parent to the FwdServers list, regardless of the
	  ps->direct value.  This could cause every request to
	  go to a parent even when always_direct is used.
	- Changed fwdServerClosed() to rotate the "forward servers"
	  list when a connection establishment fails.  Otherwise
	  it always kept trying to connect to the first server
	  int the list.

	2.2.STABLE3:

	- Fixed preprocessor problems for HP-UX in lib/safe_inet_addr.c.
	- Avoid coredump in aclMatchAcl() if someone tries to use
	  proxy authentication with a non-HTTP request (e.g. icp_access).
	- Moved 'ident_lookup_access' in squid.conf so it appears
	  after the ACL section.
	- Fixed typo in squid.conf on "Config.Addrs.snmp_outgoing"
	- Fixed a case in clientCacheHit() where we thought it
	  was a hit, but the reply status was not 200, so we
	  had to perform a cache miss.  We forgot to change the
	  log_type and these were being recorded as TCP_HIT's.
	- Fixed a void pointer subtraction bug in delayIdPtrHashCmp().
	- Fixed delay_pools coredump and memory leak bugs from
	  NULL delay_id values.
	- Fixed a SEGV bug with delay_pools when requesting
	  'objects' or 'vm_objects' from the cachemgr.
	- Added a workaround for buggy FTP servers that return
	  a size of zero for non-zero-sized objects.
	- Removed umask(0) call from main().
	- Fixed a peer selection bug that caused us to never select
	  a neighbor based on ICP replies if the ICP timeout occurs.
	  In conjunction with this, removed the PING_TIMEOUT state.
	- Fixed a store_rebuild bug that caused us to get stuck trying
	  if a cache_dir subdirectory didn't exist.
	- Fixed a buffer overrun bug in gb_to_str().

	2.2.STABLE4:

	- Fixed a dread_ctrl leak caused in store_client.c
	- Fixed a memory leak in eventRun().
	- Fixed a memory leak of ErrorState structures due to
	  a bug in forward.c.
	- Fixed detection of subdomain collisions for SPLAY trees.
	- Fixed logging of hierarchy codes for SSL requests (Henrik
	  Nordstrom).
	- Added some descriptions to mib.txt.
	- Fixed a bug with non-hierarchical requests (e.g. POST) 
	  and cache digests.  We used to look up non-hierarchical
	  requests in peer digests.  A false hit may cause Squid
	  to forward a request to a sibling.  In combination with
	  'Cache-control: only-if-cached, this generates 504 Gateway
	  Timeout responses and the request may not be re-forwardable.
	- Fixed a filedescriptor leak for some aborted requests.  


Changes to Squid-2.1 (November 16, 1998):

	- Changed delayPoolsUpdate() to be called as an event.
	- Replaced comm_select FD scanning loops with global fd_set
	  structures.  Inspired by Jeff Mogul's patch for squid 1.1.
	- Moved functions common to dns.c, redirect.c, authenticate.c,
	  ipcache.c, and fqdncache.c into helper.c.
	- Changed storeClientCopy2() so that it keeps sending the remainder
	  of a STORE_ABORTED request, instead of cutting off the client as
	  soon as the object becomes aborted.
	- Fixed combined ipf-transparent proxy and a local http-accelerator
	  operation (Quinton Dolan).
	- Rewrote base64_decode.c because of potential buffer overrun
	  bugs.
	- Configurable handling of whitespace in request URI's.
	  See 'uri_whitespace' in squid.conf.
	- Added ability to generate HTTP redirect messages from
	  the redirector output by prepending "301:" or "302:" to the
	  new url.  See FAQ 4.16 for more details.
	- Eliminated refreshWhen() which was out-of-sync with refreshCheck()
	  potentially causing under-utilized cache digests
	- Maintain refreshCheck statistics on per-protocol basis so we
	  can tell why ICP or Digests return too many misses, etc.
	- Fixed delay_pools.c class2/class3 typo (Simon Woods).
	- Changed squid.conf's default access controls to deny all
	  HTTP requests.  Admins must write ACL rules to specifically
	  allow their local clients.
	- Patched French error messages (Mathias HERBERTS).
	- NextStep porting fixes by Mike Laster:
		- use xstrdup() in cf_gen.c
		- check for putenv() in configure
		- #define S_ISDIR macro
	- Added --disable-poll configure option (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed internal URL hostname case bugs (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Patched ftp.c so we never cache autenticated FTP requests
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed FTP authentication. We tried to unescape authentication
	  given by basic authentication which is not URL escaped
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed HTTP version for common logfile format (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Added 'redirect_rewrites_host_header' option to disable rewriting
	  of Host header for redirector responses (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Allow semi-customized error message signatures (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed bug with errors for unsupported requests (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed handling of blank lines in ACL input files (Henrik
	  Nordstrom).
	- Changed proxy_auth ACL type to consist of a list of valid
	  users. REQUIRED == any (same as ident ACL). ACL type user
	  changed to ident since this is what it really is.
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed long URL bugs; make sure 'log_uri' never exceeds
	  MAX_URL bytes.
	- Allow comments in external ACL files (Gerhard Wiesinger).
	- Added 'range_offset_limit' configuration option.  Requests
	  with ranges that start after this value will be passed
	  on unmodified, and Squid will not cache the response
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Added Client HTTP Hit byte counters to 'counters' output
	  (Douglas Swarin).
	- Got Squid to compile with --enable-async-io on FreeBSD.
	- Fixed infinite loop bug for cachemgr 'config' option.
	- Fixed cachability bugs for replies with Pragma: no-cache.
	- Made content-type multipart/x-mixed-replace uncachable.
	- Y2K fix for parsing dates in "Wed Jun  9 01:29:59 1993 GMT"
	  format (Richard Kettlewell).
	- Fixed passing -s option to dnsserver processes (Alvaro Jose
	  Fernandez Lago).
	- Changed proxy_auth to work on internal objects and when in
	  accelerator mode. (Henrik Nordstrom)
	- Added login=user:password option to cache_peer directive to
	  be used from a dial-up cache where the parent requires proxy
	  authentication. (Henrik Nordstrom)
	- If you want to "auto-login", then use a URL on the form
	  http://username:password@server/.... Squid now picks this up
	  when going direct, and turns it into basic WWW
	  authentication.  It is also possible to do automatic login to
	  certain servers by using a redirector to add the needed
	  authentication information.  (Henrik Nordstrom)
	- Changed refreshCheck() so that objects with negative age
	  are always stale.
	- Fixed "plain" FTP listings (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed showing banner/logon message for top-level FTP
	  directories (Henrik Nordstrom).
	* Changes below have been made to SQUID_2_1_PATCH1
	- Fixed pinger packet size assertion.
	- Fixed WAIS forwarding.
	- Fixed dnsserver coredump bug caused by using both -D and
	  -s options.
	* Changes below have been made to SQUID_2_1_PATCH2
	- Fixed EBIT macro bugs when the bitmask is a 64-bit long.
	- Fixed proxy auth NULL password bug.
	- Fixed queueing of multiple peerRefreshDNS events.
	- Added a stack of StoreEntry objects to be released after
	  store rebuild completes.
	- Fixed NULL pointer bugs with too-large requests (found by
	  Martin Lathoud).
	- Fixed reading replies from buggy ident servers.  Replies
	  might not have terminating CR or LF (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Changed internal StoreEntry key so that the request method
	  is encoded as a single octet.  Encoding an enumerated type
	  has size and byte-order incompatibilities, especially for
	  cache digests.
	- Fixed storeEntryLocked so that SPECIAL, but PRIVATE entries
	  are not always locked.  This fixes having multiple
	  store_digest's stuck in memory.
	- Fixed clientProcessOnlyIfCachedMiss so it unlocks and
	  unregisters from "cache hit" entries.
	* Changes below have been made to SQUID_2_1_PATCH3
	- Fixed memory leak in clientHandleIMSReply for
	  storeClientCopy failures.

Changes to Squid-2.0 (October 2, 1998):

	- Added NAT/Transparent hijacking code from Quinton Dolan.
	- Added actual filesystem usage to cachemgr 'storedir' page.
	  Only works for operating systems which support statvfs().
	- Fixed HTCP compile-time bugs.
	- Fixed quick_abort bugs.  Configured values are stored as
	  Kbytes, not bytes.
	- Removed fwdAbortFetch().  It breaks quick_abort and seems
	  mostly useless.
	- Changed storeDirSelectSwapDir() to skip swap directories
	  when their utilization is over the high water mark ratio.
	- Fixed off-by-one bug for dead neighbor detection (Joe Ramey).
	- fixed bugs in Content-Range header generation
	- changed the way Range requests are handled:
		- do not "advertise" our ability to process ranges at
		  all
		- on hits, handle simple ranges and forward complex
		  ones
		- on misses, fetch the whole document for simple ranges
		  and forward range request for complex ranges
	  The change is supposed to decrease the number of cases when
	  clients such as Adobe acrobat reader get confused when we
	  send a "200" response instead of "206" (because we cannot
	  handle complex ranges, even for hits) Note: Support for
	  complex ranges requires storage of partial objects.
	- Removed SNMP mib-2.system group from squid.
	- Removed SNMP ability to iterate through ipcache and friends.
	- Added SNMP ipcache/fqdncache basic statistics.
	- Converted SQUID-MIB to SMIv2 (RFC 1902).
	- Moved SQUID-MIB to enterprises section of the tree in preparation
	  of the split into PROXY-MIB & SQUID-MIB.
	- Corrected minor errors in SQUID-MIB.
	- Moved uptime into cacheSystem from cacheConfig.
	- Corrected a number of get-next-request bugs, snmpwalk should now
	  return all objects and not skip some.
	- Fixed netdbClosestParent() so it won't return sibling
	  peers.
	- Fixed a bug with secondary clients on entries with
	  ENTRY_BAD_LENGTH set.  We should release the
	  bad entry to prevent secondary clients jumping on.
	- Changed MIB to prevent parse warnings at startup.
	* Changes below have been made to SQUID_2_0_PATCH1
	- Fixed a forwarding loop bug.  Even though we were detecting
	  a loop, it was not being broken.
	- Try to prevent sibling forwarding loops by NOT forwarding a
	  request to a sibling if we have a stale copy of the object.
	  Validation requests should only be sent to parents (or
	  direct).
	- Fixed ncsa_auth hash bugs when re-reading password file.
	- Changed clientHierarchical() so that by default SSL/CONNECT
	  requests do NOT go to neighbor caches.
	- Changed clientHandleIMSReply() to not call storeAbort()
	  because there can be more than one client hanging on the
	  StoreEntry.  This hopefully fixes "store_status !=
	  STORE_ABORTED" assertions.
	- Added temporary fix to httpMakePublic() to prevent assertions
	  (!EBIT_TEST(e->flags, RELEASE_REQUEST)) in storeSetPublicKey().
	* Changes below have been made to SQUID_2_0_PATCH2
	- PATCH1 introduced a seriously stupid bug which prevented ICP
	  queries for all requests.  Fixed by checking
	  request->hierarchical in peerSelectFoo().

Changes to squid-1.2.beta25 (September 21, 1998):

	- Fixed async IO bugs from adding filedescriptor arg to AIOCB
	  callbacks (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed store_swapout.c assertion.  We were freeing object data
	  past the swapout_done offset.  This probably happens (only?)
	  when an object changes from cachable to uncachable while
	  it is being swapped out.
	- Added MEM_CLIENT_SOCK_BUF type so we can change the size
	  of the buffers used for writing data to the client sockets.
	- Added configure check for libbind.a.  If found, it will be
	  used instead of libresolv.a.
	- Changed fwdStart() to always allow internally generated
	  requests, such as for peer digests.  These requests are
	  known to fwdStart() because the address arg is set to
	  'no_addr'.
	- Completed initial HTCP implementation.  It works, but is not
	  tested much.
	- Added counters for I/O syscalls.
	- Fixed httpMaybeRemovePublic.  With broken ICP neighbors
	  (netapp) Squid doesn't use private keys.  This caused us
	  to remove almost every object from the cache.
	- Added 'asndb' cachemgr stats to show AS Number tree.
	- Fixed AS Number byte-order bug for netmasks.
	- Fixed comm_incoming calling rate for high loads (Stewart
	  Forster).
	- Give always_direct higher precedence than never_direct
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Changed PORT ACL type to accept ranges.  Now you can easily
	   deny, for example, all priveleged ports except 80, 70, 21,
	   etc.
	- ARP ACL fixes for Linux (David Luyer).
	- Replaced various "EBIT" flags bitfileds with structures of
	  "int:1" members.
	- Changed storeKeyPrivate and storeKeyPublic to be a bit more
	  efficient by removing snprintf().  This causes an
	  incompatibility with old cache keys, however.  To transition,
	  we will look up both the new and old style keys for about the
	  next 30 days.  After that, if you haven't run this (or a
	  future) version, your cache contents will be lost.
	- Made the client-side write buffer size configurable with
	  a #define in defines.h.  By default it is still 4096 bytes.
	- Removed redirectUnregister().  It should be unnecessary
	  because of cbdata locks.
	- Fixed multiple HEAD request brokennesses (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Changed non-blocking connect(2) code to call getsockopt()
	  instead of connect() again.  This is the approach recommended
	  by Stevens, and fixes bugs on BSD-ish systems when subsequent
	  connect() calls loop with EAGAIN status.
	- Added MD5 cache keys to memory pool accounting.
	- Added code to track number of open DISK descriptors and stop
	  swapping out objects if the number of disk descriptors becomes
	  too large.  For now the limit must be manually configured with
	  the 'max_open_disk_fds'.  By default, there is no limit.
	- Stopped encoding a request method in the high byte of the ICP
	  reqnum field.  Instead queried cache keys are copied to a
	  static array, indexed by the reqnum, modulo the array size.
	  Now we just use the request number to lookup a cache key,
	  instead of rebuilding it from the ICP reply URL and method,
	  unless we have netapp neighbors--they don't do reqnum
	  properly.
	- Fixed reconfigure memory access bugs in redirect.c.
	- Ignore unreasonably large ICP RTT values which cause overflow
	  bugs in calculating the average RTT (thanks Niall!)

Changes to squid-1.2.beta24 (August 21, 1998):

	- Added Bulgarian error pages by Evgeny Gechev.
	- Changed StoreEntry->lock_count to a u_short.
	- Replaced urlcmp with strcmp
	- Fixed pragma no-cache ejecting ENTRY_SPECIAL objects
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Eliminated unneeded BASE HREF on "root" directories (Henrik
	  Nordstrom).
	- Fixed peerDigestFetchFinish() assertion caused by forwarding
	  failures (e.g. miss_access rules).
	- Changed signal handlers with ASYNC_IO and Linux so that
	  -k command line options work (Miquel van Smoorenburg).
	- Rewrote shutdown code to use events instead of setting 
	  FD timeouts.
	- Fixed cachemgr 'objects' (statObjects()) by adding a check
	  for READ_AHEAD_GAP, and calling storeCheckSwapout() in
	  storeBufferFlush().  Otherwise, the read-past pages would
	  never be freed.
	- Fixed DNSSERVER shutdown bugs.  The re-opened dnsserver processes
	  were being closed by the dnsServerShutdown event.
	- Modified storeHashInsert() to insert PRIVATE objects at
	  the tail of the LRU list, and PUBLIC objects at the head.
	  Thus, PRIVATE objects get kicked out quicker.
	- Added David Luyer's DELAY_POOLS code.
	- Fixed a bug due to HEAD replies which lack the end-of-headers
	  line.
	- Made proxy-auth realm string configurable (Bob Franklin)
	- Changed default mime time to a viewable one (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- configure fixes for Sony's NEWS-OS 6.x (Makoto MATSUSHITA).
	- Fixed 'you are running out of filedescriptors' bug which
	  could cause the HTTP incoming connection handler to not
	  be reset.
	- Changed syslog logging.  Now squid debug levels 0 and 1 go
	  to syslog.  Level 0 gets LOG_WARNING and level 1 gets LOG_NOTICE
	  (this needs more work!)
	- Fixed memory access errors in statAvgTick().
	- Fixed duplicate requestUnlink() bug in forward.c
	- Fixed possible memory access bugs from not setting e->mem_obj
	  = NULL in destroy_MemObject().
	- Deleted TCP_IMS_MISS tag.  Always use TCP_IMS_HIT instead.
	- Modified headersEnd and httpMsgIsolateHeaders to account
	  for funky line terminations such as CRCRNL.
	  (``but Netscape and IE _tolerate_ this'')
	- Fixed carp functions (Eric Stern).
	- Replaced internal proxy_auth code with extern authentication
	  module (Arjan de Vet).
	- moved hash.c to libmiscutil.a.
	- Fixed handling of ICP queries with whitespace in URLs.
	  Now we return ICP error and escape the URL before logging.
	- Added configure check for socklen_t (David Luyer).
	- Removed USE_SPLAY #defines; it is now standard.
	- Added FD arg to async IO callbacks (AIOCB) so we can eliminate
	  temporary disk_ctrl_t structures.
	- Changed ENOSPC disk write errors to reduce specific cache_dir
	  sizes, and not just the size of the cache as a whole.
	- Added httpMaybeRemovePublic() to purge public objects for
	  certain responses even though they are uncachable.  This is
	  needed, for example, when an initially cachable object
	  later becomes uncachable.
	- Added refresh_pattern options to ignore client reloads
	  (Henrik Nordstrom)
	- Relocated disk.c code which combines blocks for writing
	  (Stewart Forster).

Changes to squid-1.2.beta23 (June 22, 1998):

	- Added Turkish error pages by Tural KAPTAN.
	- Added basic support for Range requests. For most cachable
	  requests, Squid replies with an "Accept-Ranges" header. Upon
	  receiving a potentially cachable Range request for a not
	  cached object, Squid requests the whole object from origin
	  server and then replies with specified range(s) to the
	  client. Multi-range requests are supported. Adjacent
	  overlapping ranges are merged. If-Range requests are
	  supported.  Limitations:  Multi-range requests with out of
	  order ranges are not supported.
	- Made md5.c use standard memcpy and memset if they are
	  avaliable.
	- Memory pools will now shrink if Squid is run-time
	  reconfigured with smaller value of memory_pools_limit tag.
	- Added counter for number of clients (Tomi Hakala).
	- Changed neighbor UP/DOWN algorithm to require 10 failed TCP
	  connections for UP->DOWN transition.
	- Added 'unique_hostname' configuration option when its
	  necessary to have multiple machines with the same visible
	  hostname.
	- Fixed pumpReadFromClient() to not read too many bytes on
	  persistent connections.
	- We can now cache HTTP replies with Set-Cookie.  These evil
	  headers are now filtered out for cache hits on the client
	  side.
	- Fixed SNMP bugs caused by using snmpwalk.
	- Fixed snmp system Group; all objects are now returned.
	- Fixed snmp system Group sysDescr and sysContact.
	- Fixed snmp system Group sysObjectID it now returns a OBJECT
	  IDENTIFIER.
	- Allocate FwdState from mem pools.
	- Minor HTCP progress.
	- Moved 'miss_access' ACL check from client_side.c to forward.c
	- Fixed logging of usernames for requests which require
	  proxy-authentication.
	- Fixed HTTP request parser to accept lowercase HTTP identifier
	  (Oskar Pearson).
	- Fixed FTP listings to always include links to the parent
	  directory (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed FTP to show an "empty" listing instead of showing
	  a "document contains no data" error (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed refreshCheck() bug.  Often it was checking the
	  refresh patterns against the string "[null_mem_obj]"
	  because we moved URLs to MemObject.
	- Added CARP support by Eric Stern.
	- Fixed select-spin bug when an ICP reply actually gets queued
	  and we failed to execute the write callback.
	- Fixed a storeCheckSwapOut bug.  We were freeing up to
	  the queued offset instead of the done offset.  This
	  resulted in a small chunk of object data not being in
	  memory and not yet written to disk.  A client could
	  recieve a partial object because file_read() unexpectedly
	  returns EOF.
	- Fixed proxy-authentication hangs (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed request_t->flags bug causing authenticated, proxied
	  responses to be cached (Arjan de Vet).
	- Fixed MIME types for .tgz extension (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Added view and download options to FTP listings (Henrik
	  Nordstrom).
	- Modified configure to allow using pre-installed libdlmalloc.a
	  (Masashi Fujita).
	- Fixed cachemgr 'objects' implementation.
	- Changed refreshCheck() algorithm.   For cached objects, we
	  now check, in the following order:
		* request max-age
		* response Expires (if present)
		* refresh_pattern max-age
		* response Last-Modified compared to refresh_pattern
		  LM-factor (only if Last-Modified is present)
		* refresh_pattern min-age
	- Changed Copyrights.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta22 (June 1, 1998):

	- do not cut off "; parameter" from "digitized" Content-Type 
	  http fields
	- Added X-Request-URI for persistent connection debugging 
	  (Henrik Nordstrom)
	- Added Polish error pages from Maciej Kozinski.
	- Fixed hash_first/hash_next bugs with **Current pointer.
	  Replaced with *next pointer.
	- Fixed PUT/POST bugs in client (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Deny forwarding loops in httpd accel mode (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed eventRun "spin" bug when event delta time == 0.
	- Fixed setting Last Modified time on cached entries when
	  receiving a 304 reply.
	- Added while loop in httpAccept().
	- Added while loop in icpHandleUdp().
	- Fixed some small memory leaks.
	- Fixed single-bit-int flag checks (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Replaced "complex" (offset accounting) calls to snprintf with MemBuf
	- Do not send only-if-cached cc directive with requests 
	  for peer's digests.
	- Added "automatic tuning" for incoming request rate, i.e.
	  how often to check HTTP and ICP sockets.  See comm.c
	  comments for details.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta21 (May 22, 1998):

	- Added Italian error pages by Alessio Bragadini.
	- Added Estonian error pages by Toomas Soome.
	- Added Russian (koi-r) error pages by Andrew L. Davydov.
	- Added Czech error pages by Jakub Nantl.
	- Fixed asnAclInitialize calling to prevent coredump.
	- Fixed FTP directory parsing again.
	- Made FTP directory listing "Generated" tagline like
	  the one for error pages.
	- Fixed an assertion coredump in statHistCopy from 
	  reconfiguring with different #peers in squid.conf
	- Ignore leading whitespace on requests (and replies).  RFC
	  2068 section 4.1, robustness (Henrik Nordstrom)
	- Fixed keep_alive bug.  We did not always honour reply
	  headers, but rather assumed connections could be persistent.
	- Fixed reading whois output for AS numbers, especially when
	  they are longer than 4 KB.
	- Removed 'cache_stoplist_pattern' configuration option.  This
	  feature is now handled by 'no_cache'.
	- If a URN resolves to only one URL, just return it immediately
	  instead of giving the user a "choice" (Andy Powell).
	- Fixed year-2000 bug in lib/iso3307.c (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Changed squid-internal object names.
	- Added netdb exchange protocol.
	- Fixed wordlistDestroy() uninitialized pointer bug in
	  ftpParseControlReply.
	- Fixed redirector subprocess to show real program name.
	- Changed URN menu output to be sorted.
	- Added fast select(2) timeouts when using ASYNC_IO.
	- Added ARP ACL support for Linux (David Luyer).
	- Added binary http headers to requests
	- request_t objects are now created and destroyed in a consistent way
	- Fixed cache control printf bug
	- Added a lot of new http header ids
	- Improved Connection: header handling; now both Connection and
	  Proxy-Connection headers are checked for connection directives
	- Connection request header is now handled correctly regardless
	  of its position and the number of entries
	- Only replies with valid Content-Length can be sent with keep-alive
	  connection directive (Henrik Nordstrom)
	- Better handling of persistent connection "clues" in HTTP headers;
	  the decision now depends on HTTP version (and User-Agent exceptions)
	- Removed handling of "length=" directive in IMS headers;
	  the directive is not in the HTTP/1.1 standard;
	  standing by for objections
	- allowed/denied headers are now checked using bit masks instead of
	  strcmp loops
	- removed Uri: from allowed headers; Uri is deprecated in RFC 2068
	- removed processing of Request-Range header (not in specs?)
	- Fixed byte-order bugs in cacheDigestHashKey.
	- Changed hash_remove_link() to return void.
	- Changed ipcache_gethostbyname() to return NULL if
	  i->addrs.count == 0.
	- Added millisecond-timing to select/poll loops and event
	  queue.
	- Changed 'peerPingTimeout' value to be twice the average
	  of all the peer ICP RTT's.
	- Added 'half_closed_clients' option to force closing of
	  client connections which might only be half-closed.
	- Fixed matchDomainName coredump bug.
	- Don't cache HTTP replies with Vary: headers until we
	  get content negotiation working.
	- Fixed SSL proxying to forward full HTTP request headers.
	- Changed storeGetMemSpace().  Only purge down to the HIGH
	  water mark; move locked entries to the head of the inmem
	  list.
	- Changed clientReadRequest() to locally handle any
	  "squid-internal-static" URL for any host.
	- Disable persistent connections for client connections
	  from broken Netscape User-Agent, version 3.* (Stewart Forster)

Changes to squid-1.2.beta20 (April 24, 1998):

	- Improved support for only-if-cached cache control directive.
	- Enabled 304 replies for ENTRY_SPECIAL objects (e.g., icons).
	- Fixed 'quick_abort' percent calculation bug.
	- Fixed quick_abort FPE bug.
	- Changed more errno-checking functions to use ignoreErrno().
	- Added ERESTART to ignoreErrno() because of report from
	  a Solaris system.
	- Fixed '#elsif' typo.
	- Fixed MemPool assertion by moving memInit() to before
	  configuration parsing functions.
	- Fixed default 'announce_period' value (was 1 day, should
	  be 0) (Joe Ramey).
	- Added configure warning for low filedescriptors and pointer
	  to FAQ.
	- Fixed httpBodySet() bug causing URN related coredumps.
	- Changed ipcacheCycleAddr() to always cycle through all all
	  available addresses, and not just advance when one of
	  them goes BAD.
	- Fixed squid-internal bug for mixed-case hostnames (Henrik
	  Nordstrom).
	- Fixed ICP counting probelm.  icpUdpSend() arg should be
	  LOG_ICP_QUERY instead of LOG_TAG_NONE.
	- Added some additional fault toleranse on FTP data channels
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Corrected error reporting on FTP "hacks" (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Added lock/unlock for StoreEntry during storeAbort().
	- Added filemap bit usage stats to cachemgr 'storedir' and
	  'info'.
	- Replaced 'cache_stoplist' with 'no_cache' Access list.
	- Fixed (hopefully) remaining swapfile-open-at-exit bugs.
	- Fixed default hierarchy_stoplist to be ``default if none.''
	- Fixed 'fake a recent reply' hack for detecting DEAD
	  and ALIVE neighbors (Joe Ramey).
	- Fixed FTP directory parsing bugs (Joe Ramey).
	- Fixed ftpTraverseDirectory coredump for NULL ftpState->filepath
	  (Joe Ramey).
	- Fixed daylight savings time bug (again).
	- A lot of Cache Digests additions, fixes, and tuning. 
	  Cache Digests are still "very experimental".
	- Fixed snprintf() bug.  When len == 1, snprintf() would treat
	  the buffer as unknown size, emulating sprintf() behaviour.
	- Made Error page language configurable with configure script
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed squid-internal URLs when http_port == 80.
	- Remember the client address on redirected requests (Henrik
	  Nordstrom).
	- Don't rebuild the request if the redirector returned the same
	  URL (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Rewrite Host: header on redirected requests (Henrik
	  Nordstrom).
	- Include port (if non-standard) in generated Host: headers
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed rfc1123 timezone hacks for Windows NT
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Added Russian Error pages by Ilia Zadorozhko.
	- Added totals for ICP and HTTP hits to cachemgr client_list
	  output.
	- Changed error message to 'Generated TIME by HOST (SQUID/VER)'
	  because any string with an '@' must be an email address.
	- Fixed POST for content-length == 0.
	- Fixed "huge 304 reply" loop bug.
	- Fixed --enable-splaytree compile bugs.
	- Removed ASN lookup code in peer_select.c.
	- Added warnings if ACL code detects subdomains in SPLAY
	  trees.
	- Rewrote some bits of httpRequestFree() to eliminate
	  possible bugs that could cause an "e->lock_count" asseertion.
	- Added value/bounds checking to _db_init() when setting
	  the debugLevels[] array.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta19 (Apr 8, 1998):

	- Squid-1.2.beta19 compiles and runs on Windows/NT with
	  Cygnus Gnu-WIN32 b19 (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Added French Error pages by Frank DENIS.
	- Added Dutch Error pages by Mark Visser
	- Added German Error pages by Bernd P. Ziller, Jens Frank,
	  and Anke S.
	- Added support for only-if-cached cache-control directive.
	- Added RELAXED_HTTP_PARSER #define to allow requests which are
	  missing the HTTP identifier on the request line (e.g. buggy
	  SpyGame queries).  RELAXED_HTTP_PARSER is undefined by default.
	- Fixed disk.c FD leak for delayed closes in
	  diskHandleWriteComplete().
	- Fixed cache announcement feature.
	- Fixed httpReadReply() to retry failed HTTP requests on
	  persistent connections when read() returns -1, not only
	  when it returns 0.
	- Fixed cbdata memory counting leak.  cbdataUnlock() always
	  called free(), never memFree().
	- Fixed storeDirWriteCleanLogs() malloc bug on Alphas.
	- Fixed `++loopdetect < 10' assertion due to
	  clientHandleIMSReply bug for invalid/partial HTTP
	  replies.
	- Added preliminary code for HTCP.
	- Renamed 'aux' dir to 'cfgaux' for legacy DOS machines.
	- Added "snmp_community" as an ACL type.
	- Cleaned up proxy-auth acl implementation and removed
	  memory leaks.
	- Added generic 'hashFreeItems()' function for efficiently
	  freeing hash table pointers.
	- Added whoisTimeout() for ASN code.
	- Removed BINARY TREE code.
	- Fixed forgetting to reset Config.Swap.maxSize in
	  configDoConfigure.
	- Fixed httpReplyUpdateOnNotModified() arguments-in-wrong-order
	  bug which caused not modified replies to not get updated.
	- Fixed client_side.c bugs which could cause data to be written
	  to the client in the wrong order for persistent connections.
	  clientPurgeRequest() and clientHandleIMSComplete() must not
	  call comm_write().  Instead they must create and write to
	  StoreEntry's.
	- Fixed ICP query service time counting bug(s).
	- replaced 'char *mime_headers_end()' with 'size_t headersEnd()'
	  to fix buffer overruns.  This also requires adding 'buf_sz'
	  args to some functions like clientBuildReplyHeader().
	  But we can eliminate the need to NULL-terminate the
	  buffer beforehand.
	- Changed commConnectCallback() to reset the FD timeout to
	  zero before notifying about the connection.  This requires
	  commSetTimeout() calls in numerous places to reinstall
	  timeouts.
	- Changed comm_poll_incoming() to be called less frequently
	  (every 15 I/O's instead of every 7 FD's) (Michael O'Reilly).
	- Removed HAVE_SYSLOG case for debug() macro.  Almost all
	  systems do have syslog(), but more importatnly the
	  _db_level value is needed for debugging to stderr.
	- Rewrote squid/dnsserver interface to use smaller, single-line
	  messages.
	- Rewrote 'dns' cachemgr output to use a table format.
	- Rewrote a lot of dnsserver.c.
	- Added eventAddIsh() for semi-random event scheduling.
	- Fixed an ftpTimeout bug for sessions which use PORT
	  commands.
	- Fixed ftp.c to recognized invalid PASV replies (e.g.
	  port == 0).
	- Removed hash_insert().  All hasing uses hash_join() now.
	- Renamed hash_unlink() to hash_remove_link().
	- Added hashPrime() to find closes prime hash table size
	  to a given value.
	- Fixed Keep-Alive ratio counting bug which prevented
	  persistent connections from being used between cache
	  peers.
	- Changed icmp.c to NOT queue messages sent from squid to
	  the pinger program.
	- Changed icp_v2.c to NOT queue ICP messages by default.
	  But they will be queued and resent once if the first
	  send fails.  Counters.icp.queued_replies counts the
	  number of messaages queued.
	- Cleaned up ICP logging.
	- Added identTimeout().
	- Fixed ipcache reply counting bug.  Overcounted dnsserver
	  replies for partial replies.
	- Added urlInternal() for building internal Squid URLs.
	- Changed peerAllowedToUse() to check both 'cache_peer_domain'
	  AND 'cache_peer_acl' configurations.  This should be changed
	  in the fugure to use ONLY cache_peer_acl.
	- Changed DEAD/REVIVED neighbor detection to avoid reporting
	  so many false deaths.  (Joe Ramey).
	- Added some preliminary code to support "cache digests."
	- Fixed pumpClose() coredumps (?).
	- Updated cachemgr 'info' output to show median service
	  times for various categories.
	- Fixed ABW bug in storeDirWriteCleanLogs().  sizeof(off_t)
	  != sizeof(int) for Alphas.
	- Fixed potential alignment problem in storeDirWriteCleanLogs().
	- Fixed store_rebuild.c to NOT replace current, but
	  not-swapped-out StoreEntry's with on-disk entries.
	- Changed storeCleanup() to call storeRelease on invalid
	  entries which don't have a swapfile (i.e. no unlink()
	  penalty).
	- Fixed storeSwapInStart() to fail for unvalidated
	  entries.
	- SNMP changes:
	  .  renovated mib and added descriptions and comments
	  .  added hit and byte counters to client_db , for
	     cacheClientTable
	  .  cacheClientTable, netdbTable, cachePeerTable,
	     cacheConnTable now indexed by ip address. hash_lookup was
	     enhanced to allow for subsequent hash_next's similar to
	     hash_first, to speed up getnext's in tables which refer to
	     hash-table structures.
	  .  added generic (well, sorf of) table indexing functionality
	  .  added makefile dependencies for snmplib and cache_snmp.h
	  .  WaisHost, WaisPort, Timeouts removed
	  .  FdTable split into FdTable and ConnTable. FdTable simplified
	  .  PeerTable and PeerStat merged and put into new cacheMesh
	     group
	  .  cacheClientTable added for client statistics and accounting 
	     (cacheMesh 2)
	  .  cacheSec and cacheAccounting groups removed 
	  .  fixed acl bug when communities not defined
	  .  snmp_acl now survives bad configuration

Changes to squid-1.2.beta18 (Mar 23, 1998):

	- Added v1.1 'test_reachability' option.
	- Fixed hash4() len == 0 bug.
	- Fixed Config.Swap.maxSize reconfigure bug.
	- Fixed ICP query bug determining request method.
	- Moved ICP's storeGet() cache lookup into neighborsUdpAck()
	  so that we know neighbors are alive even when they send
	  us replies for unknown entries.
	- Changed configure script to add '-std1' for Digital Unix cc.
	- Fixed SNMP sizeof(int) / sizeof(long) bugs for 64-bit
	  systems.
	- Added support for 'Cache-Control: Only-If-Cached' request header.
	- Fixed CheckQuickAbort() bugs for multiple clients on one
	  StoreEntry.  Also changed storePendingNClients() to return
	  mem->nclients instead of counting the number of store_client
	  entries with pending callback functions.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta17 (Mar 17, 1998):

	- SNMP MIB version check changed to non-rcs.
	- Added memory pools for variable size objects (strings).
	  There are three pools; for small, medium, and large objects.  
	- Extended String object to use memory pools.  Most fixed size char
	  array fields will be replaced using string pools. Same for most
	  malloc()-ed buffers.
	- Changed icon handling to use the hostname and port of the squid
	  server, instead of the special hostname "internal.squid"
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- All icons are now configured in mime.conf. No hardcoded icons,
	  including gohper icons (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed ICP bug when we send queries, but expect zero
	  replies.
	- Fixed alignment/casting bugs for ICP messages.
	- A generic client-to-server "pump" was added to handle HTTP
	  PUT as well as POST methods on the client-cache side. Based on
	  "pump" PUT requests can be made to either HTTP or FTP url's.
	  Code is still beta and interoperability with browsers etc has
	  not been tested.
	- Put #ifdefs around 'source_ping' code.
	- Added missing typedef for _arp_ip_data (Wesha).
	- Added regular-expression-based ACLs for client and server
	  domain names (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed ident-related coredumps from incorrect callback data.
	- Fixed parse_rfc1123() "space" bug.
	- Fixed xrealloc() XMALLOC_DEBUG bug (not calling check_free())..
	- Fixed some src/asn.c end-of-reply bugs and memory leaks.
	- Fixed some peer->options flag-setting bugs.
	- Fixed single-parent feature to work again
	- Removed 'single_parent_bypass' configuration option; instead
	  just use 'no-query'.
	- Surrounded 'source_ping' code with #ifdefs.
	- Changed 'deny_info URL' to use a custom Error page.
	- Modified src/client.c for testing POST requests.
	- Fixed hash4() for SCO (Vlado Potisk).

Changes to squid-1.2.beta16 (Mar 4, 1998):

	- Added Spanish error messages from Javier Puche.
	- Added Portuguese error messages from Pedro Lineu Orso
	- Added a simple but very effective hack to cachemgr.cgi that tries to
	  interpret lines with '\t' as table records and formats them
	  accordingly. With a few exceptions (see source code), first line
	  becomes a table heading ("<th>" html tag) and the rest is formated
	  with "<td>" tags.
	- Added "mem_pools_limit" configuration option. Semantics of
	  "mem_pools" option has also changed a bit to reflect new memory
	  management policy.
	- Reorganized memory pools. Squid now supports a global pool
	  limit instead of individual pool limits. Per-pool limits can be
	  implemented on top of the current scheme if needed, but it is
	  probably hard to guess their values.  Squid distributes pool
	  memory among "frequently allocated" objects.  There is a
	  configurable limit on the total amount of "idle" memory to be
	  kept in reserve. All requests that exceed that amount are
	  satisfied using malloc library.  Support for variable size
	  objects (mostly strings) will be enabled soon.
	- memAllocate() has now only one parameter. Objects are always
	  reset with 0s. (We actually never used that parameter before;
	  it was always set to "clear").
	- Added Squid "signature" to all ERR_ pages. The signature is
	  hardcoded and is added on-the-fly. The signature may use
	  %-escapes.  Added interface to add more hard-coded responses if
	  needed (see errorpage.c::error_hard_text).
	- Both default and configured directories are searched for ERR_
	  pages now. Configured directory is, of course, searched first.
	  This allows you to customize a subset of ERR_ pages (in a
	  separate directory) without danger of getting other copies out
	  of sync.
	- Security controls for the SNMP agent added. Besides
	  communities (like password) and views (part of tree
	  accessible), the snmp_acl config option can be used to do acl
	  based access checks per community.
	- SNMP agent was heavily re-written, based on cmu-snmpV1.8. You
	  can now walk through the whole mib tree. Several new variables
	  added under cacheProtoAggregateStats
	- Added rudimental statistics for HTTP headers.
	- Adjusted StatLogHist to a more generic/flexible StatHist.
	  Moved StatHist implementation into a separate file.
	- Added FTP support for PORT if PASV fails, also try the
	  default FTP data port (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed NULL pointer bug in clientGetHeadersForIMS when a
	  request is cancelled for fails on the client side.
	- Filled in some squid.conf comments (never_direct,
	  always_direct).
	- Added RES_DNSRCH to dnsserver's _res.options when the 
	  -D command line option is given.
	- Fixed repeated Detected DEAD/REVIVED Sibling messages when
	  peer->tcp_up == 0 (Michael O'Reilly).
	- Fixed storeGetNextFile's incorrect "directory does not exist"
	  errors (Michael O'Reilly).
	- Fixed aiops.c race condition (Michael O'Reilly, Stewart
	  Forster).
	- Added 'dns_nameservers' config option to specify non-default
	  DNS nameserver addresses (Maxim Krasnyansky).
	- Added lib/util.c code to show memory map as a tree
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Added HTTP and ICP median service times to Counters and
	  cachemgr average stats.
	- Changed "-d" command line option to take debugging level
	  as argument.  Debugging equal-to or less-than the argument
	  will be written to stderr.
	- Removed unused urlClean() function from url.c.        
	- Fixed a bug that allowed '?' parts of urls to be recorded in
	  store.log.  Logged urls are now "clean".
	- Cache Manager got new Web interface (cachemgr.cgi). New .cgi
	  script forwards basic authentication from browser to squid.
	  Authentication info is encoded within all dynamically generated
	  pages so you do not have to type your password often.
	  Authentication records expire after 3 hours (default) since
	  last use. Cachemgr.cgi now recognizes "action protection" types
	  described below.
	- Added better recognition of available protection for actions
	  in Cache Manager. Actions are classified as "public" (no
	  password needed), "protected" (must specify a valid password),
	  "disabled" (those with a "disable" password in squid.conf), and
	  "hidden" (actions that require a password, but do not have
	  corresponding cachemgr_passwd entry). If you manage to request
	  a hidden, disabled, or unknown action, squid replies with
	  "Invalid URL" message. If a password is needed, and you failed
	  to provide one, squid replies with "Access Denied" message and
	  asks you to authenticate yourself.
	- Added "basic" authentication scheme for the Cache Manager.
	  When a password protected function is accessed, Squid sends an
	  HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED reply allowing the client to authorize itself
	  by specifying "name" and "password" for the specified action.
	  The user name is currently used for logging purposes only.  The
	  password must be an appropriate "cachemgr_passwd" entry from
	  squid.conf. The old interface (appending @password to the url)
	  is still supported but discouraged.  Note: it is not possible
	  to pass authentication information between squid and browser
	  *via a web server*. The server will strip all authentication
	  headers coming from the browser. A similar problem exists for
	  Proxy-Authentication scheme.
	- Added ERR_CACHE_MGR_ACCESS_DENIED page to notify of
	  authentication failures when accessing Cache Manager.
	- Added "-v" (Verbose) and "-H" (extra Headers) options to client.c.
	- Added simple context-based debugging to debug.c. Currently,
	  the context is defined as a constant string. Context reporting
	  is triggered by debug() calls.  Context debugging routines
	  print minimal amount of information sufficient to describe
	  current context. The interface will be enhanced in the future.
	- Replaced _http_reply with HttpReply. HttpReply is a
	  stand-alone object that is responsible for parsing, swapping,
	  and comm_writing of HTTP replies. Moved these functions from
	  various modules into HttpReply module.
	- Added HttpStatusLine, HttpHeader, HttpBody.
	- All HTTP headers are now parsed and stored in a "compiled"
	  form in the HttpHeader object.  This allows for a great
	  flexibility in header processing and builds basis for support
	  of yet unsupported HTTP headers.
	- Added Packer, a memory/store redirector with a printf
	  interface.  Packer allows to comm_write() or swap() an object
	  using a single routine.
	- Added MemBuf, a auto-growing memory buffer with printf
	  capabilities.  MemBuf replaces most of old local buffers for
	  compiling text messages.
	- Added MemPool that maintains a pre-allocated pool of opaque
	  objects.  Used to eliminate memory thrashing when allocating
	  small objects (e.g.  field-names and field-value in http
	  headers).

Changes to squid-1.2.beta15 (Feb 13, 1998):

	NOTE: This version has changes which may cause all or part
	      of your cache to be lost.  However, you can problably
	      save most of it by doing a slow restart.  Specifically:

	1. Kill the running squid-1.2.beta14 process; wait for it to
	   fully exit.
	2. Remove all 'swap.state*' files, either in each cache_dir, or
	   as defined in your squid.conf
	3. Start squid-1.2.beta15.   The store will be rebuilt from the
	   existing swap files, reading the directories and opening
	   the files.

	- Fixed some problems related to disk (and pipe) write error
	  handling.  file_close() doesn't always close the file
	  immediately; i.e. when there are pending buffers to write.
	  StoreEntry->lock_count could become zero while a write is
	  pending, then bad things happen during the callback.
	- The file_write() callback data must now be in the callback
	  database (cbdata).  We now use the swapout_ctrl_t structure
	  for the callback data; it stays around for as long as we are
	  swapping out.
	- Changed the way write errors are handled by diskHandleWrite.
	  If there is no callback function, now we exit with a fatal
	  message under the assumption that the file in question is a
	  log file or IPC pipe.  Otherwise, we flush all the pending
	  write buffers (so we don't see multiple repeated write errors
	  from the same descriptor) and let the upper layer decide how
	  to handle the failure.
	- Fixed storeDirWriteCleanLogs.  A write failure was leaving
	  some empty swap.state files, even though it tells us that its
	  "not replacing the file."  Don't flush/rename logs which we
	  have prematurely closed due to write failures, indiciated by
	  fd[dirn] == -1.  Close these files LAST, not before
	  renaming.
	- Fixed storeDirClean to clean directories in a more sensible
	  order, instead of the new "MONOTONIC" order for swap files.
	- Merged fdstat.c functions into fd.c.
	- Cleaned up some debugging sections.  Some unrelated source
	  files were using the same section.
	- Removed curly brackets from all cachemgr output.
	- Removed unused filemap->last_file_number_allocated member.
	- Removed unused fde->lifetime_data member.
	- Fixed incorrectly applying htonl() on icp_common_t->shostid.
	- Call setsid() before exec() in ipc.c so that child processes
	  don't receive SIGINT (etc) when running squid on a tty.
	- Changed StoreEntry->object_len to ->swap_file_sz so we
	  can verify the disk file size at restart.  Moved object_len
	  to MemObject->object_sz.  Note object_sz is initialized
	  to -1.  If object_sz < 0, then we need to open the swap
	  file and read the swap metadata.
	- Changed store_client->mem to ->entry because we need
	  e->swap_file_sz to set mem->object_sz at swapin.
	- Renamed storeSwapData structure to storeSwapLogData.
	- Fixed storeGetNextFile to not increment d->dirn.  Added
	  check for opendir() failure.
	- Fixed storeRebuildStart to properly link the directory
	  list for storeRebuildfromDirectory mode.
	- Added -S command line option to double-check store
	  consistency with disk files in storeCleanup().
	- Fixed a problem with transactional logging.  In many
	  cases we were adding the public cache key and then
	  logging a delete for the private key.  This is worthless
	  because during rebuild we could not locate the previous
	  public-keyed entry.  Now we assert that only public-keyed
	  entries can be logged to swap.state.  storeSetPublicKey()
	  and storeSetPrivateKey() have been modified to log an
	  ADD or DEL when the key changes.
	- Fixed storeDirClean bug.  Needed to call
	  storeDirProperFileno() so the "dirn bits" get set.
	- Fixed a storeRebuildFromDirectory bug.  fullpath[] and
	  fullfilename[] were static to that function and did
	  not change when the "rebuild_dir" arg did.  Moved these
	  buffers to the rebuild_dir structure.
	- In storeRebuildFromSwapLog, we were calling storeRelease()
	  for cache key collisions.  This only set the RELEASE_REQUEST
	  bit and did not clear the swap_file_number in the filemap or
	  in the StoreEntry, so the swap file could get unlinked later
	  when it was really released.
	- Fixed FTP so that ';type=X' specifically sets the HTTP reply
	  content-type and content-encoding (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Removed 'icon_content_type' configuration option.  Content
	  types now taken from mime.conf (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Added additional memory malloc tracing and memory leak
	  detection.  Use --enable-xmalloc-debug-trace configure
	  option and -m command line option  (Henrik Nordstrom).

Changes to squid-1.2.beta14 (Feb 6, 1998):

	- Replaced snmplib free() calls with xfree().
	- Changed the 'net_db_name' hash table structure to
	  make it easier to move names from one network to another
	  (copied from 1.1 code).
	- Filled in some of the config dump routines (dump_acl,
	  dump_acl_access).
	- Full memory debugging option (--enable-xmalloc-debug-trace)
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Filled-in and clarified many squid.conf comments (Oskar
	  Pearson).
	- Fixed up handling of SWAP_LOG_DEL swap.state entries.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta13 (Feb 4, 1998):

	- NOTE: With this version the "swap.state" file format has
	  changed.  Running this version for the first time will
	  cause your current cache contents to be lost!
	- NOTE: this version still has the bug where we don't rewind
	  a swapout file and rewrite the swap meta data.  Objects
	  larger than 8KB will be lost when rebuilding from the swap
	  files.
	- Combined various interprocess communication setup functions
	  into ipcCreate().
	- Removed some leftover ICP_HIT_OBJ things.
	- Removed cacheinfo and proto_count() and friends; these are to
	  be replaced in functionality by StatCounters and 5/60 minute
	  average views via cachemgr.
	- Fixed --enable-acltree configure message (Masashi Fujita).
	- Fixed no reference to @LIB_MALLOC@ in src/Makefile.in
	  (Masashi Fujita).
	- Fixed building outside of source tree (Masashi Fujita).
	- FTP: Format NLST listings, and inform the user that the NLST
	  (plain) format is available when we find a LIST listing that we
	  don't understand (Henrik Nordstrom)
	- FTP: Use SIZE on Binary transfers, and not ASCII. The
	  condition was inversed, making squid use SIZE on ASCII
	  transfers (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Enable virtual and Host: based acceleration in order to be
	  able to use Squid as a transparent proxy without breaking
	  either virtual servers or clients not sending Host: header
	  the order of the virtual and Host: based acceleration needs
	  to be swapped, giving Host: a higher precendence than virtual
	  host (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Use memmove/bcopy as detected by configure Some systems does
	  not have memmove, but have the older bcopy implementation
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Completely rewritten aiops.c that creates and manages a pool
	  of threads so thread creation overhead is eliminated (SLF).
	- Lots of mods to store.c to detect and cancel outstanding
	  ASYNC ops.  Code is not proven exhaustive and there are
	  definately still cases to be found where outstanding disk ops
	  aren't cancelled properly (SLF).
	- Changes to call interface to a few routines to support disk
	  op `tagging', so operations can be cleanly cancelled on
	  store_abort()s (SLF).
	- Implementation of swap.state files as transaction logs.
	  Removed objects are now noted with a negative object size.
	  This allows reliatively clean rebuilds from non-clean
	  shutdowns (SLF).
	- Now that the swap.state files are transaction logs, there's
	  now no need to validate by stat()ing.  All the validation
	  procedure does is now just set the valid bit AFTER all the
	  swap.state files have been read, because by that time, only
	  valid objects can be left.  Object still need to be marked
	  invalid when reading the swap.state file because there's no
	  guarantee the file has been retaken or deleted (SLF).
	- An fstat() call is now added after every
	  storeSwapInFileOpened() so object sizes can be checked.   Added
	  code to storeRelease() the object if the sizes don't match (SLF).
	- #defining USE_ASYNC_IO now uses the async unlink() rather than
	  unlinkd() (SLF).
	- #defining MONOTONIC_STORE will support the creation of disk
	  objects clustered into directories.  This GREATLY improves disk
	  performance (factor of 3) over old `write-over-old-object'
	  method.  If using the MONOTONIC_STORE, the
	  {get/put}_unusedFileno stack stuff is disabled.  This is
	  actually a good thing and greatly reduces the risk of serving
	  up bad objects (SLF).
	- Fixed unlink() in storeWriteCleanLogs to be real unlink()
	  rather than ASYNC/unlinkd unlinks.  swap.state.new files were
	  being removed just after they were created due to delayed
	  unlinks (SLF).
	- Disabled various assertions and made these into debug warning
	  messages to make the code more stable until the bugs can be
	  tracked down (SLF).
	- Added most of Michael O'Reilly's patches which included many
	  bug fixes.  Ask him for full details (SLF).
	- Moved aio_check_callbacks in comm_{poll|select}().  It was
	  called after the fdset had been built which was wrong because
	  the callbacks were changing the state of the read/write
	  handlers prior to the poll/select() calls (SLF).
	- Fixed ARP ACL memory leaks (Dale).
	- Eliminated URL and SHA cache keys.  Cache keys will always
	  be MD5's now.
	- Fixed up store swap meta data.
	- Changed swap.state logs to a binary format.
	- The swap.state logs are written transaction-style.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta12 (Jan 30, 1998):

	- Added metadata headers to cache swap files.  This is an
	  incompatible change with previous versions.  Running this
	  version for the first time will cause your current cache
	  contents to be lost.
	- -D_REENTRANT when linking with -lpthreads (Henrik Nordstrom)
	- Show symlink destinations as a hyperlink in FTP listings
	  (Henrik Nordstrom)
	- Fixed not allocating enough space for rewriting URLs with
	  the Host: header (Eric Stern).
	- Year-2000 fixes (Arjan de Vet).
	- Fixed looping for cache hits on HEAD requests.
	- Fixed parseHttpRequest() coredump for 
	  "GET http://foo HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Changes to squid-1.2.beta11 (Jan 6, 1998):

	- Fixed fake 'struct rusage' definition which prevented compling
	  on Solaris 2.4.
	- Fixed copy-by-ref bug for request->headers in
	  clientRedirectDone() (Michael O'Reilly).
	- Workaround for Solaris pthreads closing FD 0 upon fork()
	  (Michael O'Reilly).
	- Fixed shutdown bug with outgoing UDP sockets; we need to
	  disable their read handlers.
	- For comm_poll(), use the fast 50 msec timeout only when
	  USE_ASYNC_IO is defined.
	- Fixed pointer bug when freeing AS# ACL entries.
	- Fixed forgetting to reset Config.npeers to zero in free_peer().
	- Fixed ICP bug causing excessive TIMEOUTs with sibling
	  neighbors.  We must call the ICP reply callback even for
	  sibling misses.
	- Fixed some dnsserver-related reconfigure bugs. Need to 
	  use cbdataLock, etc in fqdncache.c.  Also don't want to
	  use ipcacheQueueDrain() and fqdncacheQueueDrain().
	- Fixed persistent connection bug.  We were incorrectly
	  deciding that non-200 replies without content-length
	  would not have a reply body.
	- Fixed intAverage() precedence bug.
	- Fixed memmove() 'len' arg bug.
	- Changed algorithm for determining alive/dead state of peers.
	  Instead of using a fixed number of unacknowledged ICP
	  replies, it is now based on timeouts.  If there are no ICP
	  replies received from a peer within 'dead_peer_timeout'
	  seconds, then we call it dead.
	- Added calls to getCurrentTime() in
	  comm_{select,poll}_incoming() when ALARM_UPDATES_TIME is not
	  being used.
	- Fixed shutdown bug when the incoming and outgoing ICP socket
	  is the same file descriptor.
	- Added buffered writes for storeWriteCleanLogs() (Stewart
	  Forster).
	- Patches for Qnx4 (Jean-Claude MICHOT).
	- Fixed returning void functions which seems to be a GCC-ism.
	- New configure script options (Henrik Nordstrom):
		--enable-new-storekey=[sha|md5(|url)] (was --enable-hashkey)
		--enable-acltree
		--enable-icmp
		--enable-delay-hack
		--enable-useragent-log
		--enable-kill-parent  (this should be named -hack)
		--enable-snmp
		--enable-time-hack
		--enable-cachemgr-hostname[=hostname]   (new)
		--enable-arp-acl  (new)
	- Added Doug Lea malloc-2.6.4 to the distribution, so that
	  people easily can try a decent malloc package if they syspect
	  their malloc is broken.  --enable-dlmalloc (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Made XMALLOC_DEBUG_COUNT working again. Requires a small stub
	  function (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Removed top-level Makefile.  People must now run 'configure'
	  before 'make'.
	- Fixed checkFailureRatio() implementation.
	- Made 'squid -z' behave like the 1.1 version.


Changes to squid-1.2.beta10 (Jan 1, 1998):

	- Fixed content-length bugs for 204 replies, 304 replies,
	  and HEAD requests (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed errorAppendEntry() bug in gopherReadReply().
	- Basic support for FTP URL typecodes (;type=X).
	- Support for access controls based on ethernet MAC addresses
	  (Dale).
	- Initial URN support; see
	  http://squid.nlanr.net/Squid/urn-support.html
	- Fixed client-side persistent connections for objects with
	  bad content lengths (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed bad call to storeDirUpdateSwapSize() for objects which
	  never reach SWAPOUT_DONE state.
	- Fixed up poll() #defines in squid.h (Stewart Forster).
	- Changed poll() timeout from 1000 msec to 50 msec for
	  better performance under low load (Stewart Forster).
	- Changed storeWriteCleanLogs() to write objects in the LRU
	  list order instead of the random hash table order.
	- Fixed FTP bug when data socket connections fail or timeout.
	- Reuse FTP data connection when possible (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Added configure options (Henrik Nordstrom)
		--enable-store-key=sha|md5
		--enable-xmalloc-statistics
		--enable-xmalloc-debug
		--enable-xmalloc-debug-count 
		--async-io 
	- Fixed confusing with the use/meaning of ERR_CANNOT_FORWARD
	  by creating ERR_FORWARDING_DENIED and changing the
	  content of the ERR_CANNOT_FORWARD text.
	- Fixed pipeline request bug from using strdup() (Henrik
	  Nordstrom).
	- Call clientReadRequest() directly instead of commSetSelect()
	  for pipelined requests (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Fixed 4k page leak in icpHandleIMSReply();
	- Renamed 'icp*' functions to 'client*' names in client_side.c.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta8 (Dec 2, 1997):

	- Fixed accessLogLog() to log ident from Proxy-Authorization
	  request header (BoB Miorelli).
	- Fixed #includes, prototypes, etc. in SNMP source files.
	- Moved 'POLLRDNORM' and 'POLLWRNORM' macro checks from
	  include/config.h.in to src/squid.h
	- Moved 'num32' typedefs from src/typedefs.h to
	  include/config.h.in.
	- Moved snmplib/md5.c to lib/md5.c.
	- Added MD5 cache key support.
	- Removed xmalloc() return check in uudeocde.c
	- Added 'ifdef' support to cf_gen.c for optional code (e.g. SNMP)
	- Changed 'client' program to provide easier cache manager access,
	  e.g.: 'client mgr:info'
	- Fixed 'client' to send 'Connection' instead of 'Proxy-Connection'
	  for simulated keep-alive requests.
	- Removed 'fd' arg from clientProcess* functions.
	- Fixed bugs from using errorSend() on persistent/pipelined
	  client connections.  A latter request should not be allowed to
	  write to the client fd until the current request completes.
	  Now use errorAppendEntry() for such situations.
	- Fixed content-length bugs.  We were using content-length == 0
	  to also indicate a lack of content-length reply header.  But
	  'content-length: 0' might appear in a reply, so now use -1 to
	  indicate that no content length given.
	- Split up clientProcessRequest() into smaller chunks so it
	  might be easier to follow.
	- renamed various client_side.c functions to start with 'client'
	  instead of 'icp'.
	- Fixed a 'cbdata leak' from the comm.c close handlers.
	- Fixed a 'cbdata leak' from the comm.c connect routines.
	- Fixed comm_select() and comm_poll() to stop looping on the
	  incoming HTTP/ICP sockets.  If there are fewer than 7 FD's
	  ready for I/O, the incoming sockets might not get service, so
	  comm_select() would be called for up to 7 times until the
	  'incoming_counter' was incremented enough to trigger a call
	  to comm_select_incoming().  Now we make sure
	  comm_select_incoming() gets called if select returns less
	  than 7 ready FD's.
	- Added errorpage '%B' token to generate FTP URLs with a '%2f'
	  inserted at the start of the url-path.  calls ftpUrlWith2f().
	  (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Changed fqdncache.c to use LRU double-linked list instead of qsort()
	  for replacement and cachemgr output.
	- Changed ipcache.c to use LRU double-linked list instead of qsort()
	- Changed hash_insert() and hash_join() to return void.
	  for replacement and cachemgr output.
	- Moved StoreEntry->method member to MemObject->method.
	- Made StoreEntry->flags 16 bits.
	- Made StoreEntry->refcount 16 bits.
	- Changed URL-based public cache key to always include the request
	  method.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta7 (Nov 24, 1997):

	- Fixed poll() for Linux (David Luyer).
	- SHA optimizations (David Luyer).
	- Fixed errno clashes with macro on Linux (David Luyer).
	- Fixed storeDirCloseSwapLogs(); logs might not be open.
	- Fixed storeClientCopy2() bug.  Detect when there is
	  no more data to send for objects in STORE_OK state.
	- Fixed FTP truncation bug when ftpState->size == 0, e.g.
	  especially directory listings.
	- Mega FTP fix from Henrik Nordstrom.  A better job of
	  implementing the '%2f' hack.
	- Fixed some pipelined request bugs.  storeClientCopy() was
	  being given the wrong StoreEntry, and we had a race condition
	  which is now handled by storeClientCopyPending().
	- Added initial SNMP support.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta6 (Nov 13, 1997):

	- Fixed Authorized responses getting swapped out when they
	  don't have Proxy-Revalidate reply header.
	- Fixed Proxy Authentication support.  We never sent back
	  a 407 reply, and were incorrectly incrementing the passwd
	  before comparing it.
	- Fixed stat()ing pathnames for default values before parsing
	  config file (Ron Gomes).
	- Fixed logging request and response headers on separate lines
	  (Ron Gomes).
	- Fixed FTP Authentication message (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Changed Proxy Authentication to trigger a reread of the passwd
	  file if a password check fails (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Changed FTP to retry the first CWD with a leading slash if it
	  fails without one.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta5 (Nov 6, 1997):

	- Track the 'keep-alive ratio' for a peer as the ratio of
	  the number of replies including 'Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive'
	  compared to the number of requests sent.  If the peer does
	  not support Persistent connections then this ratio will tend
	  toward zero.  If the ratio is less than 50% after 10 requests
	  then we'll stop sending Keep-Alive.
	- Proper support for %nn escapes in FTP, and numerous
	  other fixes (Henrik Nordstrom).
	- Support for Secure Hash Algorithm and framework for other
	  hash functions as cache keys.
	- Fixed SSL snprintf() bug which broke SSL proxying.
	- Fixed store_dir swap log bug from reconfigure (SIGHUP).
	- Fixed LRU Reference Age bug.  The arg to pow() must be
	  minutes, not seconds.

Changes to squid-1.2.beta4 (Oct 30, 1997):

	- Fixed DST bug in rfc1123.c
	- Changed default http_accel_port to 80.
	- added errorCon() as a ErrorState constructor function
	  (Max Okumoto).
	- Added ERR_FTP_FAILURE message for ftpFail().
	- For FTP, the timeout callback must be moved to the 'data'
	  descriptor when data transfer begins.  Otherwise we are
	  likely to get a timeout on the control descriptor.
	- Fixed double-free bug in httpRequestFree().
	- Fixed store_swap_size counting bug in storeSwapOutHandle().

Changes to squid-1.2.beta3 (Oct 29, 1997):

	- Initialize _res.options to RES_DEFAULT in dnsserver.c.
	- Fix assertions which assumed 4-byte pointers.
	- Fix missing % in fqdncache.c snprintf().
	
Changes to squid-1.2.beta2 (Oct 28, 1997):

	- Fixed aiops.c and async_io.c so that they actually compile
	  with USE_ASYNC_IO (Arjan de Vet).
	- Fixed errState->errno causing problems with some macros
	  (Michael O'Reilly).
	- Fixed memory leaks in pconn.c (Max Okumoto).
	- Enhanced 'client' program with 'ping' behaviour (Ron Gomes).
	- Fixed InvokeHandlers() from calling memCopy() for ALL
	  store_client's with callbacks.  A store_client might be reading
	  from disk.
	- Rewrote storeMaintainSwapSpace().  No longer will we scan one
	  bucket at a time.  Instead we'll maintain a single LRU
	  list.  When an object is 'touched' we move it to the
	  top of this list.  When we need disk space, we delete
	  from the bottom.
	- Removed storeGetSwapSpace().
	
Changes to squid-1.2.beta1 ():

	- Reworked storage manager to not keep objects in memory during
	  transit.  In other words, no separate NOVM distribution.
	- Lots of cleanup and debugging for beta release.
	- Use snprintf() everywhere instead of sprintf().
	- The 'in_memory' hash table has been replaced with a
	  doubly-linked list.  New objects are added to the head of
	  the list.  When memory space is needed, old objects are
	  purged from the tail of the list.

Changes to squid-1.2.alpha7 ():

	- fixes fixes fixes.
	- Made Arjan's PROXY_AUTH ACL patch standard.

Changes to squid-1.2.alpha6 ():

	- Simpler cacheobj implementation.
	- persistent connection histogram
	- SERVER-SIDE PERSISTENT CONNECTIONS:
		- Added pconn.c 
		- Addec Cofig.Timeout.pconn; default 120 seconds
		- Added httpState->flags
		- Added flags arg to httpBuildRequestHeader()
		- Added HTTP_PROXYING and HTTP_KEEPALIVE flags
		- Added 'Connection' to allowed HTTP headers (http-anon.c)
		- Added 'Proxy-Connection' to allowed HTTP headers
		  (http-anon.c)
		- Merged proxyhttpStart() with httpStart() and created
		  new httpBuildState().
		- New httpPconnTransferDone() detects end-of-data on
		  persistent connections.

Changes to squid-1.2.alpha5 ():

	- New configuration system.  Everything is generated from
	  'cf.data.pre', including the main parser, setting defaults,
	  outputting current values, and freeing memory.  
	  This also involved moving some of the local data structures
	  (e.g. struct _acl *AclList in acl.c) to the Config
	  structure.  (Max Okumoto)
	- No more '/i' for regular expressions.  Now insert a '-i'
	  to switch to case-insensitive.  Use '+i' for case-sensitive.
	- When you have a variable named the same as its type, sizeof()
	  gets the wrong one (fde).
	- Need to flush unbuffered logs before fork().
	- Added two fields swap log: refcount and e->flag.
	- Removed all the .h files for each .c file.  Now #include stuff
	  is in either: defines.h, enums.h, typedefs.h, structs.h,
	  or protos.h, globals.h.  This greatly reduces dependencies
	  between the various source files.
	- globals.c is generated from globals.h by a Perl script.
	- Started customizable error texts.

Changes to squid-1.2.alpha4 ():

	- New MIME configuration, regular expression based
	- Added request_timeout config option
	- Multiple HTTP sockets (Lincoln Dale).
	- Moved 'fds_are_n_free' check to httpAccept().
	- s/USE_POLL/HAVE_POLL/; make poll() default if available.
	- Changed storeRegister to use offsets and make immediate
	  callbacks if appropriate.
	- Removed icpDetectClientClose().  Some of that functionality
	  goes into clientReadRequest() and the rest into
	  httpRequestFree().
	- Moved IP lookups to commConnect stuff.
	- Added support for retrying connect().
	- New inline debug() macro (David Luyer).
	- Replace frequent gettimeofday() calls with alarm(3) based
	  clock.  Need to add more gettimeofday() calls to get back
	  high-resolution timestamp logging (Andres Kroonmaa).
	- Added support for Cache-control: proxy-revalidate;
	  based on squid-1.1 patch from Mike Mitchell.

Changes to squid-1.2.alpha3 ():

	- Implemented persistent connections between clients and squid.
	- Moved various FD tables (comm.c, fdstat.c, disk.c) to a single
	  table in fd.c.
	- Removed use of FD as an identifier in certain callback
	  operations (ipcache, fqdncache).
	- General code cleanup.
	- Fixed typedefs for callback functions.
	- Removed FD lifetime/timeout dichotomy.  Now we only have
	  timeouts, however the lifetime concept/keyword may still
	  linger in certain places.
	- Change Makefile 'realclean' target to 'distclean'
	- Changed config file parsing of time specifications to use
	  parseTimeLine().
	- Removed storetoString.c

Changes to squid-1.2.alpha2 ():

	- Merged squid-1.1.9, squid-1.1.10 changes

Changes to squid-1.2.alpha1 ():

	- Unified peer selection algorithm.
	- aiops.c and aiops.h are a threaded implementation of
	  asynchronous file operations (Stewart Forster).
	- async_io.c and async_io.h are complete rewrites of the old
	  versions (Stewart Forster).
	- Rewrote all disk file operations of squid to support
	  the idea of callbacks except where not required (Stewart
	  Forster).
	- Background validation of 'tainted' swap log entries (Stewart
	  Forster).
	- Modified storeWriteCleanLog to create the log file using the
	  open/write rather than fopen/printf (Stewart Forster).
	- Added the EINTR error response to handle badly interrupted
	  system calls (Stewart Forster).
	- UDP_HIT_OBJ not supported, removed.
	- Different sized 'cache_dirs' supported.
