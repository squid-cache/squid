Changes to squid-1.0.beta1 (Apr 19, 1996) from Harvest cached-1.4.pl3:

	- Added a "server mode" to ftpget.  Now the (much smaller)
	  ftpget process forks for each FTP request.
	- Added support for If-Modified-Since GET requests.
	- Added support for SSL and https objects.
	- Added background processing for rebuilding the disk store
	  while serving requests.  Cache can now serve requests immediately.
	- Added a 'reconfigure' feature activated by SIGHUP.  The config
	  file is re-read and most changes will take effect.
	- Added an internal flag for using private keys with ICP queries
	  to neighbors.  If any neighbor returns a reqnum field of zero,
	  then disable using private keys.  But still use private
	  keys for things with bypass the ICP query step (such as POST
	  and IMS-GET).
	- Added a function to verify content-lengths.  Objects with
	  mismatched (but non-zero) content lenghts will be ejected.
	- Added clean shutdown mode.  On SIGTERM the incoming HTTP socket
	  is closed.  Active clients are given a lifetime of 30 seconds
	  (configurable).  Process exits when all sockets are closed.
	- Added support for large POST objects.
	- Added "store.log" which logs RELEASE/SWAPIN/SWAPOUT events.
	- Added announce feature to squid; no longer external program.
	  If enabled, a running cache will announce itself every 24 hrs.
	- Added support for FTP URLs with non-default ports.
	- Added new Access Control List scheme.
	- Added Forwarded: header to proxy HTTP requests (HTTP/1.1 feature).
	- Added weights neighbors.
	- Added urlParse() which strips off default ports and 
	  makes hostnames all lowercase.
	- Added (section,level) debugging and 'debug_options' config line.
	- Added 'pid_filename' to configuration file.
	- Added 'visible_hostname' to configuration file.
	- added 'ftp_user' to configuration file.
	- added 'dns_positive_ttl' to configuration file.
	- added 'dns_negative_ttl' to configuration file.
	- Added 'shutdown_lifetime' to configuration file.
	- Fixed bug where cache process would "spin" on large objects
	  being deferred.
	- Fixed byte order conversion bug on setting echo port.
	- Changed meaning of command line -b (buffered logs) option.
	  Now the default behaviour is unbuffered logs, use -b to make
	  them buffered.
	- Changed WAIS code to always be fully compiled in.
	- Changed the storage manager to use the notion of private and
	  public keys.  Requests are now private until the reply headers
	  have been read.
	- Changed access logging significantly.  Entries to "access.log"
	  are written when the client connection closes.  Every connection
	  is logged exactly once, always with a valid size.
	- Changed access log format (non-common) to include request
	  method and sub-second timestamps.
	- Changed handing of ECONNRESET (connection reset) errors.
	  Now treated like any other read error.
	- Changed 'rotate logs' to be activated by SIGUSR1.
	- Changed configure script to look specifically for tm_gmtoff
	  and set HAVE_TM_GMTOFF.
	- Changed configure script to look specifically extended mallinfo
	  structure and set HAVE_EXT_MALLINFO
	- Changed ICP reply code to use negative TTL value as UDP_HIT
	  threshold so we never return a HIT on neg-cached objects.
	- Changed ftpget to use select(2) on I/O for timeouts.  ftpget
	  now exits immediately if stdin goes away.
	- Changed handling of '-z' option.  Now only execute 'rm -rf ...' if
	  -U option also given.
	- Removed the command line -d (debug) option.  Use 'debug_options'
	  in config file.
	- Removed all code and references to binary port.
	- Removed dual logging to stderr/cache.log.
	- Removed old IP access controls ('proxy_allow', etc.)

Changes to 1.0.beta2:

	- Fixed /bin/csh "$#argv" leftover in RunCache.
	- Fixed ACL day-of-week bitmask bug.
	- Fixed missing checks for WAIS in some places.
	- Fixed chdir(swappath(0)) bug; do chdir() after storeInit().
	- Changed enumerated structure members to be defined outside
	  of the structure itself (for AIX).
	- Changed ftpget to fork before reading the request and make
	  sure the entire request is read.

Changes to 1.0.beta3:

	- Added ftpget '-C minport:maxport' option
	- Fixed PROTO_MAX fencepost bug in stat_init().
	- Fixed Fixed CheckQuickAbort() coredump.
	- Fixed disabling store.log and hierarchy.log when set to "none"
	- Fixed numerous problems related to setuid().
	- Fixed 'check_cache.pl' to use new swaplog format (without "FILE").
	- Fixed ACL coredumps when checking NULL words.
	- Changed pid_filename to be written and unlinked as root.
	- Added "-i seconds" option to 'client' for testing IMS GET.
	- Fixed a bug where an IMS request caused the valid object to
	  get ejected from the cache.
	- Fixed continual DEAD_PARENT/REVIVE bug
	- Fixed ERR_INVALID_URL bug for URLs with a password field.
	- Added to Release-Notes info about converting 'cache/log' and
	  difference between stoplists and ttl_pattern.

Changes to squid-1.0.beta4:

	- Added a handler to restart the ftpget server.
	- Fixed access checks for ICP by parsing the requested URL.
	- Added "magic marker" to ftpget-generated errors so they can
	  be negative-cached.
	- Added a small run-time check to configure to see if signal
	  handlers should be restarted after invocation (ala SYSV).
	- Determine Maximum filedescriptors in configure and change
	  FD_SETSIZE if needed.
	- Changed read stall algorithm for HTTP.  No don't wait until
	  the object is in DELETE_BEHIND mode to stall the server read
	  and wait for the client to catch up.  Also changed from 4k to
	  16k read buffer.
	- Fixed HTTP request parsing to check for blank line at the
	  end of all requests.  Symptoms were "connection reset"
	  messages.

Changes to squid-1.0.beta5:

	- Fixed cachemgr to send 'HTTP/1.0' on request so it works
	  with beta4 fixes to icp.c.
