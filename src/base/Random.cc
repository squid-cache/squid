    // * none: The default constructor in some specialized STL implementation or
    //   build might select a device that requires Squid to wait for entropy.

    // * "default": Leads to clang (and other STLs) exceptions in some builds
    //   (e.g., when clang is built to use getentropy(3) or rand_s()).

    // * "/dev/urandom": Blocks GCC from picking the best entropy source (e.g.,
    //   arc4random(3)) and leads to GCC/clang exceptions in some environments.

    // If a special supported environment needs a non-default device name, we
    // will add a random_device_name configuration directive. We cannot detect
    // such needs in general code and choose to write simpler code until then.
