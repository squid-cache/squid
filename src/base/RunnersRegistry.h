/**
 * This API allows virtually any module to register its interest in receiving
 * notification about initial configuration availability, configuration changes
 * and other critical events in Squid lifetime without exposing the notifier
 * to the details of the module.
 *
 * For example, main.cc may activate registered I/O modules after parsing
 * squid.conf and deactivate them before exiting, all without knowing what
 * those I/O modules really are.
 *
 * A module in this context is code providing a functionality or service to the
 * rest of Squid, such as src/DiskIO/Blocking, src/fs/ufs, or Cache Manager. To
 * receive notifications, a module must declare a RegisteredRunner child class
 * and implement the methods corresponding to the events the module is
 * interested in.
 *
 * The order of events is documented in this header (where applicable), but
 * the order in which runners are notified about a given event is undefined.
 * If a specific notification order is required, split the event into two or
 * more related event(s), documenting their relative order here.
