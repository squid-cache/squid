.SH NAME
ext_time_quota_acl \- Squid time quota external acl helper.
.PP
Version 1.0
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.if !'po4a'hide' .B ext_time_quota_acl
.if !'po4a'hide' .B "[\-b database] [\-l logfile] [\-d] [\-p pauselen] [\-h] configfile
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ext_time_quota_acl
allows an administrator to define time budgets for the users of squid
to limit the time using squid.
.PP
This is useful for corporate lunch time allocations, wifi portal
pay-per-minute installations or for parental control of children. The
administrator can define a time budget (e.g. 1 hour per day) which is enforced
through this helper.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.if !'po4a'hide' .TP
.if !'po4a'hide' .B "\-b database"
.B Filename
of persistent database. This defaults to ext_time_quota.db in Squids state
directory.
.
.if !'po4a'hide' .TP
.if !'po4a'hide' .B "\-p pauselen"
.B Pauselen
is given in seconds and defines the period between two requests to be treated as part of the same session.
Pauses shorter than this value will be counted against the quota, longer ones ignored.
Default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
.
.if !'po4a'hide' .TP
.if !'po4a'hide' .B "\-l logfile"
.B Filename
where all logging and debugging information will be written. If none is given,
then stderr will be used and the logging will go to Squids main cache.log.
.
.if !'po4a'hide' .TP
.if !'po4a'hide' .B "\-d"
Enables debug logging in the logfile.
.
.if !'po4a'hide' .TP
.if !'po4a'hide' .B "\-h"
show a short command line help.
.
.if !'po4a'hide' .TP
.if !'po4a'hide' .B configfile
This file contains the definition of the time budgets for the users.
.PP
.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
The time quotas of the users are defined in a text file typically
residing in /etc/squid/time_quota. Any line starting with "#" contains
a comment and is ignored. Every line must start with a user
followed by a time budget and a corresponding time period separated by
"/". Here is an example file:
.PP
.if !'po4a'hide' .RS
# user budget / period
.if !'po4a'hide' .br
.if !'po4a'hide' .B john 8h / 1d
.if !'po4a'hide' .br
.if !'po4a'hide' .B littlejoe 1h / 1d
.if !'po4a'hide' .br
.if !'po4a'hide' .B babymary 30m / 1w
.if !'po4a'hide' .br
.if !'po4a'hide' .RE
.PP
John has a time budget of 8 hours every day, littlejoe is only allowed
1 hour and the poor babymary only 30 minutes a week.
.PP
You can use "s" for seconds, "m" for minutes, "h" for hours, "d" for
days and "w" for weeks. Numerical values can be given as integer
values or with a fraction. E.g. "0.5h" means 30 minutes.
.PP
This helper is configured in 
.B squid.conf 
using the
.B external_acl_type 
directive then access controls which use it to allow or deny.
.
.PP
Here is an example.
.PP
.if !'po4a'hide' .RS
# Ensure that users have a valid login. We need their username.
.if !'po4a'hide' .br
.if !'po4a'hide' .br
.if !'po4a'hide' .B acl users proxy_auth REQUIRED
.if !'po4a'hide' .br
.if !'po4a'hide' .B http_access deny !users
.if !'po4a'hide' .br
# Define program and quota file
.if !'po4a'hide' .br
.if !'po4a'hide' .B external_acl_type time_quota ttl=60 children-max=1 %LOGIN /usr/libexec/ext_time_quota_acl /etc/squid/time_quota
.if !'po4a'hide' .br
.if !'po4a'hide' .br
.if !'po4a'hide' .B acl noquota src all
.if !'po4a'hide' .br
.if !'po4a'hide' .B acl time_quota external time_quota
.if !'po4a'hide' .br
.if !'po4a'hide' .B deny_info ERR_ACL_TIME_QUOTA_EXCEEDED noquota
.if !'po4a'hide' .br
.if !'po4a'hide' .B http_access deny !time_quota noquota
.if !'po4a'hide' .RE
.
.PP
In this example, after restarting Squid it should allow access only for users as long as they have time budget left.
If the budget is exceeded the user will be presented with an error page informing them.
.PP
In this example we use separate 
.B users 
access control and 
.B noquota 
ACL in order to keep the username and password prompt and the quota-exceeded messages separated.
.
.PP
User is just a unique key value. The above example uses %LOGIN and the username but any of the 
.B external_acl_type 
format tags can be substituted in its place. 
.B %EXT_TAG
,
.B %LOGIN
, 
.B %IDENT
, 
.B %EXT_USER
, 
.B %SRC 
,
.B %SRCEUI48
, and 
.B %SRCEUI64
are all likely candidates for client identification.

.
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
This helper only controls access to the Internet through HTTP. It does
not control other protocols, like VOIP, ICQ, IRC, FTP, IMAP, SMTP or
SSH.
.
.PP
Desktop browsers are typically able to deal with authentication to HTTP proxies like
.B squid . 
But more and more different programs and devices (smartphones,
games on mobile devices, ...) are using the Internet over HTTP. These
devices are often not able to work through an authenticating proxy.
Means other than %LOGIN authentication are required to authorize these devices and software.
.
.PP
A more general control to Internet access could be a captive portal approach
(such as pfSense or ChilliSpot) using %SRC, %SRCEUI48 and %SRCEUI64 as keys 
or maybe a 802.11X solution. But the latter is often not supported by mobile devices.
.
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
When the helper is called it will be asked if the current user is allowed to
access squid. The helper will reduce the remaining time budget of this user
and return 
.B OK 
if there is budget left. Otherwise it will return 
.B ERR .
.
.PP
The 
.B ttl=N 
parameter in 
.B squid.conf 
determines how often the helper will be called, the example config uses a 1 minute TTL.
The interaction is that Squid will only call the helper on new requests
.B if
there has been more than TTL seconds passed since last check.
This handling creates an amount of slippage outside the quota by whatever amount is configured.
TTL can be set as short as desired, down to and including zero.
Though values of 1 or more are recommended due to a quota resolution of one second.
.
.PP
If the configured time period (e.g. "1w" for babymary) is over, the
time budget will be restored to the configured value thus allowing the
user to access squid with a fresh budget.
.
.PP
If the time between the current request and the previous request is greater than
.B pauselen
(default 5 minutes and adjustable with command line parameter 
.B "-p"
), the current request will be considered as a new request and the time budget will
not be decreased. If the time is less than 
.B pauselen 
, then both requests will be considered as part of the same active time period and the time budget will
be decreased by the time difference. This allows the user to take arbitrary
breaks during Internet access without losing their time budget.
.
.SH FURTHER IDEAS
The following ideas could further improve this helper. Maybe someone
wants to help? Any support or feedback is welcome!
.if !'po4a'hide' .TP
There should be a way for a user to see their configured and remaining
time budget. This could be realized by implementing a web page
accessing the database of the helper showing the corresponding
data. One of the problems to be solved is user authentication.
.if !'po4a'hide' .TP
We could always return "OK" and use the module simply as an Internet
usage tracker showing who has stayed how long in the WWW.
