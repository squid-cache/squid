/** \group STUB
 *
 *  A set of useful macros to create stub_* files.
 *
 * Intended for use building unit tests, if a stubbed function is called
 * by any code it is linked to it will abort with a message indicating
 * which API file is missing from the linked dependencies.
 *
 * Usage:
 *    at the top of your intended stub file define STUB_API to be the
 *    name of the .cc file or library you are providing a stub of
 *    then include this STUB.h header.
 *
 *   #define STUB_API "foo/libexample.la"
 *   #include "tests/STUB.h"
