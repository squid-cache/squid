	WELCOME TO SQUID @VERSION@
	----------------------------

	This is the default Squid configuration file. You may wish
	to look at the Squid home page (http://www.squid-cache.org/)
	for the FAQ and other documentation.

	The default Squid config file shows what the defaults for
	various options happen to be.  If you don't need to change the
	default, you shouldn't uncomment the line.  Doing so may cause
	run-time problems.  In some cases "none" refers to no default
	setting at all, while in other cases it refers to a valid
	option - the comments for that keyword indicate if this is the
	case.

NAME: http_port ascii_port
TYPE: http_port_list
DEFAULT: none
LOC: Config.Sockaddr.http
DOC_START
	Usage:	port [options]
		hostname:port [options]
		1.2.3.4:port [options]

	The socket addresses where Squid will listen for HTTP client
	requests.  You may specify multiple socket addresses.
	There are three forms: port alone, hostname with port, and
	IP address with port.  If you specify a hostname or IP
	address, Squid binds the socket to that specific
	address.  This replaces the old 'tcp_incoming_address'
	option.  Most likely, you do not need to bind to a specific
	address, so you can use the port number alone.

	If you are running Squid in accelerator mode, you
	probably want to listen on port 80 also, or instead.

	The -a command line option may be used to specify additional
	port(s) where Squid listens for proxy request. Such ports will
	be plain proxy ports with no options.

	You may specify multiple socket addresses on multiple lines.

	Options:

	   transparent	Support for transparent interception of
			outgoing requests without browser settings.

	   tproxy	Support Linux TPROXY for spoofing outgoing
			connections using the client IP address.

	   accel	Accelerator mode. Also needs at least one of
			vhost / vport / defaultsite.

	   defaultsite=domainname
			What to use for the Host: header if it is not present
			in a request. Determines what site (not origin server)
			accelerators should consider the default.
			Implies accel.

	   vhost	Accelerator mode using Host header for virtual
			domain support. Implies accel.

	   vport	Accelerator with IP based virtual host support.
			Implies accel.

	   vport=NN	As above, but uses specified port number rather
			than the http_port number. Implies accel.

	   protocol=	Protocol to reconstruct accelerated requests with.
			Defaults to http.

	   disable-pmtu-discovery=
			Control Path-MTU discovery usage:
			    off		lets OS decide on what to do (default).
			    transparent	disable PMTU discovery when transparent
					support is enabled.
			    always	disable always PMTU discovery.

			In many setups of transparently intercepting proxies
			Path-MTU discovery can not work on traffic towards the
			clients. This is the case when the intercepting device
			does not fully track connections and fails to forward
			ICMP must fragment messages to the cache server. If you
			have such setup and experience that certain clients
			sporadically hang or never complete requests set
			disable-pmtu-discovery option to 'transparent'.

	If you run Squid on a dual-homed machine with an internal
	and an external interface we recommend you to specify the
	internal address:port in http_port. This way Squid will only be
	visible on the internal address.

	Usage:  [ip:]port cert=certificate.pem [key=key.pem] [options...]

	The socket address where Squid will listen for HTTPS client
	requests.

	This is really only useful for situations where you are running
	squid in accelerator mode and you want to do the SSL work at the
	accelerator level.

	You may specify multiple socket addresses on multiple lines,
	each with their own SSL certificate and/or options.

	Options:

	   accel	Accelerator mode. Also needs at least one of
			defaultsite or vhost.

	   defaultsite=	The name of the https site presented on
	   		this port. Implies accel.

	   vhost	Accelerator mode using Host header for virtual
			domain support. Requires a wildcard certificate
			or other certificate valid for more than one domain.
			Implies accel.

	   protocol=	Protocol to reconstruct accelerated requests with.
			Defaults to https.

	   cert=	Path to SSL certificate (PEM format).

	   key=		Path to SSL private key file (PEM format)
			if not specified, the certificate file is
			assumed to be a combined certificate and
			key file.

	   version=	The version of SSL/TLS supported
			    1	automatic (default)
			    2	SSLv2 only
			    3	SSLv3 only

			    NO_SSLv3  Disallow the use of SSLv3
			    NO_TLSv1  Disallow the use of TLSv1
			    SINGLE_DH_USE Always create a new key when using
				      temporary/ephemeral DH key exchanges

			documentation for a complete list of options.

	   clientca=	File containing the list of CAs to use when
			requesting a client certificate.

	   cafile=	File containing additional CA certificates to
			use when verifying client certificates. If unset
			clientca will be used.

	   capath=	Directory containing additional CA certificates
			and CRL lists to use when verifying client certificates.

	   crlfile=	File of additional CRL lists to use when verifying
			the client certificate, in addition to CRLs stored in
			the capath. Implies VERIFY_CRL flag below.

	   dhparams=	File containing DH parameters for temporary/ephemeral
			DH key exchanges.

	   sslflags=	Various flags modifying the use of SSL:
			    DELAYED_AUTH
				Don't request client certificates

 OPTIONS WHICH AFFECT THE NEIGHBOR SELECTION ALGORITHM
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENT_END

NAME: cache_peer
TYPE: peer
DEFAULT: none
LOC: Config.peers
DOC_START
	To specify other caches in a hierarchy, use the format:

		cache_peer hostname type http-port icp-port [options]

	For example,

	#                                        proxy  icp
	#          hostname             type     port   port  options
	#          -------------------- -------- ----- -----  -----------
	cache_peer parent.foo.net       parent    3128  3130  proxy-only default
	cache_peer sib1.foo.net         sibling   3128  3130  proxy-only
	cache_peer sib2.foo.net         sibling   3128  3130  proxy-only

	      type:  either 'parent', 'sibling', or 'multicast'.

	proxy-port:  The port number where the cache listens for proxy
		     requests.

	  icp-port:  Used for querying neighbor caches about
		     objects.  To have a non-ICP neighbor
		     specify '7' for the ICP port and make sure the
		     neighbor machine has the UDP echo port
		     enabled in its /etc/inetd.conf file.
		NOTE: Also requires icp_port option enabled to send/receive
		      requests via this method.

	    options: proxy-only
		     weight=n
		     basetime=n
		     ttl=n
		     no-query
		     background-ping
		     default
		     round-robin
		     weighted-round-robin
		     carp
		     multicast-responder
		     closest-only
		     no-digest
		     no-netdb-exchange
		     no-delay
		     login=user:password | PASS | *:password
		     connect-timeout=nn
		     digest-url=url
		     allow-miss
		     max-conn=n
		     htcp
		     htcp-oldsquid
		     originserver
		     name=xxx
		     forceddomain=name
		     ssl
		     sslcert=/path/to/ssl/certificate
		     sslkey=/path/to/ssl/key
		     sslversion=1|2|3|4
		     sslcipher=...
		     ssloptions=...
		     front-end-https[=on|auto]

		     use 'proxy-only' to specify objects fetched
		     from this cache should not be saved locally.

		     use 'weight=n' to affect the selection of a peer
		     during any weighted peer-selection mechanisms.
		     The weight must be an integer; default is 1,
		     larger weights are favored more.
		     This option does not affect parent selection if a peering
		     protocol is not in use.

		     use 'basetime=n' to specify a base amount to
		     be subtracted from round trip times of parents.
		     It is subtracted before division by weight in calculating
		     which parent to fectch from. If the rtt is less than the
		     base time the rtt is set to a minimal value.

		     use 'ttl=n' to specify a IP multicast TTL to use
		     when sending an ICP queries to this address.
		     Only useful when sending to a multicast group.
		     Because we don't accept ICP replies from random
		     hosts, you must configure other group members as
		     peers with the 'multicast-responder' option below.

		     use 'no-query' to NOT send ICP queries to this
		     neighbor.

		     use 'background-ping' to only send ICP queries to this
		     neighbor infrequently. This is used to keep the neighbor
		     round trip time updated and is usually used in
		     conjunction with weighted-round-robin.

		     use 'default' if this is a parent cache which can
		     be used as a "last-resort" if a peer cannot be located
		     by any of the peer-selection mechanisms.
		     If specified more than once, only the first is used.

		     use 'round-robin' to define a set of parents which
		     should be used in a round-robin fashion in the
		     absence of any ICP queries.

		     use 'weighted-round-robin' to define a set of parents
		     which should be used in a round-robin fashion with the
		     frequency of each parent being based on the round trip
		     time. Closer parents are used more often.
		     Usually used for background-ping parents.

		     use 'carp' to define a set of parents which should
		     be used as a CARP array. The requests will be
		     distributed among the parents based on the CARP load
		     balancing hash function based on their weigth.

		     'multicast-responder' indicates the named peer
		     is a member of a multicast group.  ICP queries will
		     not be sent directly to the peer, but ICP replies
		     will be accepted from it.

		     'closest-only' indicates that, for ICP_OP_MISS
		     replies, we'll only forward CLOSEST_PARENT_MISSes
		     and never FIRST_PARENT_MISSes.

		     use 'no-digest' to NOT request cache digests from
		     this neighbor.

		     'no-netdb-exchange' disables requesting ICMP
		     RTT database (NetDB) from the neighbor.

		     use 'no-delay' to prevent access to this neighbor
		     from influencing the delay pools.

		     use 'login=user:password' if this is a personal/workgroup
		     proxy and your parent requires proxy authentication.
		     Note: The string can include URL escapes (i.e. %20 for
		     spaces). This also means % must be written as %%.

		     use 'login=PASS' if users must authenticate against
		     the upstream proxy or in the case of a reverse proxy
		     configuration, the origin web server.  This will pass
		     the users credentials as they are to the peer.
		     This only works for the Basic HTTP authentication scheme.
		     Note: To combine this with proxy_auth both proxies must
		     share the same user database as HTTP only allows for
		     a single login (one for proxy, one for origin server).
		     Also be warned this will expose your users proxy
		     password to the peer. USE WITH CAUTION

		     use 'login=*:password' to pass the username to the
		     upstream cache, but with a fixed password. This is meant
		     to be used when the peer is in another administrative
		     domain, but it is still needed to identify each user.
		     The star can optionally be followed by some extra
		     information which is added to the username. This can
		     be used to identify this proxy to the peer, similar to
		     the login=username:password option above.

		     use 'connect-timeout=nn' to specify a peer
		     specific connect timeout (also see the
		     peer_connect_timeout directive)

		     use 'digest-url=url' to tell Squid to fetch the cache
		     digest (if digests are enabled) for this host from
		     the specified URL rather than the Squid default
		     location.

		     use 'allow-miss' to disable Squid's use of only-if-cached
		     when forwarding requests to siblings. This is primarily
		     useful when icp_hit_stale is used by the sibling. To
		     extensive use of this option may result in forwarding
		     loops, and you should avoid having two-way peerings
		     with this option. (for example to deny peer usage on
		     requests from peer by denying cache_peer_access if the
		     source is a peer)

		     use 'max-conn=n' to limit the amount of connections Squid
		     may open to this peer.

		     use 'htcp' to send HTCP, instead of ICP, queries
		     to the neighbor.  You probably also want to
		     set the "icp port" to 4827 instead of 3130.

		     use 'htcp-oldsquid' to send HTCP to old Squid versions

		     'originserver' causes this parent peer to be contacted as
		     a origin server. Meant to be used in accelerator setups.

		     use 'name=xxx' if you have multiple peers on the same
		     host but different ports. This name can be used to
		     differentiate the peers in cache_peer_access and similar
		     directives.

		     use 'forceddomain=name' to forcibly set the Host header
		     of requests forwarded to this peer. Useful in accelerator
		     setups where the server (peer) expects a certain domain
		     name and using redirectors to feed this domain name
		     is not feasible.

		     use 'ssl' to indicate connections to this peer should
		     be SSL/TLS encrypted.

		     use 'sslcert=/path/to/ssl/certificate' to specify a client
		     SSL certificate to use when connecting to this peer.

		     use 'sslkey=/path/to/ssl/key' to specify the private SSL
		     key corresponding to sslcert above. If 'sslkey' is not
		     specified 'sslcert' is assumed to reference a
		     combined file containing both the certificate and the key.

		     use sslversion=1|2|3|4 to specify the SSL version to use
		     when connecting to this peer
			1 = automatic (default)
			2 = SSL v2 only
			3 = SSL v3 only
			4 = TLS v1 only

		     use sslcipher=... to specify the list of valid SSL ciphers
		     to use when connecting to this peer.

		     use ssloptions=... to specify various SSL engine options:
			NO_SSLv2  Disallow the use of SSLv2
			NO_SSLv3  Disallow the use of SSLv3
			NO_TLSv1  Disallow the use of TLSv1
		     See src/ssl_support.c or the OpenSSL documentation for
		     a more complete list.

		     use sslcafile=... to specify a file containing
		     additional CA certificates to use when verifying the
		     peer certificate.

		     use sslcapath=... to specify a directory containing
		     additional CA certificates to use when verifying the
		     peer certificate.

		     use sslcrlfile=... to specify a certificate revocation
		     list file to use when verifying the peer certificate.
		     
		     use sslflags=... to specify various flags modifying the
		     SSL implementation:
			DONT_VERIFY_PEER
				Accept certificates even if they fail to
				verify.
			NO_DEFAULT_CA
				Don't use the default CA list built in
				to OpenSSL.
			DONT_VERIFY_DOMAIN
				Don't verify the peer certificate
				matches the server name

		     use ssldomain= to specify the peer name as advertised
		     in it's certificate. Used for verifying the correctness
		     of the received peer certificate. If not specified the
		     peer hostname will be used.

		     use front-end-https to enable the "Front-End-Https: On"
		     header needed when using Squid as a SSL frontend in front
		     of Microsoft OWA. See MS KB document Q307347 for details
		     on this header. If set to auto the header will
		     only be added if the request is forwarded as a https://
		     URL.

NAME: cache_peer_domain cache_host_domain
TYPE: hostdomain
DEFAULT: none
LOC: none
DOC_START
	Use to limit the domains for which a neighbor cache will be
	queried.  Usage:

	cache_peer_domain cache-host domain [domain ...]
	cache_peer_domain cache-host !domain

	For example, specifying

		cache_peer_domain parent.foo.net	.edu

	has the effect such that UDP query packets are sent to
	'bigserver' only when the requested object exists on a
	server in the .edu domain.  Prefixing the domainname
	with '!' means the cache will be queried for objects
	NOT in that domain.

	NOTE:	* Any number of domains may be given for a cache-host,
		  either on the same or separate lines.
		* When multiple domains are given for a particular
		  cache-host, the first matched domain is applied.
		* Cache hosts with no domain restrictions are queried
		  for all requests.
		* There are no defaults.
		* There is also a 'cache_peer_access' tag in the ACL

	usage: neighbor_type_domain neighbor parent|sibling domain domain ...

	Modifying the neighbor type for specific domains is now
	possible.  You can treat some domains differently than the the
	default neighbor type specified on the 'cache_peer' line.
	Normally it should only be necessary to list domains which
	should be treated differently because the default neighbor type
	applies for hostnames which do not match domains listed here.

EXAMPLE:
	cache_peer  parent cache.foo.org 3128 3130

NAME: dead_peer_timeout
COMMENT: (seconds)
DEFAULT: 10 seconds
TYPE: time_t
LOC: Config.Timeout.deadPeer
DOC_START
	This controls how long Squid waits to declare a peer cache
	as "dead."  If there are no ICP replies received in this
	amount of time, Squid will declare the peer dead and not
	expect to receive any further ICP replies.  However, it
	continues to send ICP queries, and will mark the peer as
	alive upon receipt of the first subsequent ICP reply.

	This timeout also affects when Squid expects to receive ICP
	replies from peers.  If more than 'dead_peer' seconds have
	passed since the last ICP reply was received, Squid will not
	expect to receive an ICP reply on the next query.  Thus, if
	your time between requests is greater than this timeout, you
	will see a lot of requests sent DIRECT to origin servers
	instead of to your parents.

	parameter specifies the ideal upper limit on the total size of
	4 KB blocks allocated.  In-Transit objects take the highest
	priority.

	In-transit objects have priority over the others.  When
	additional space is needed for incoming data, negative-cached
	and hot objects will be released.  In other words, the
	negative-cached and hot objects will fill up any unused space
	not needed for in-transit objects.

	If circumstances require, this limit will be exceeded.
	Specifically, if your incoming request rate requires more than
	'cache_mem' of memory to hold in-transit objects, Squid will
	exceed this limit to satisfy the new requests.  When the load
	decreases, blocks will be freed until the high-water mark is
	reached.  Thereafter, blocks will be used to store hot
	objects.

 DISK CACHE OPTIONS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENT_END

NAME: cache_dir
TYPE: cachedir
DEFAULT: none
DEFAULT_IF_NONE: ufs @DEFAULT_SWAP_DIR@ 100 16 256
LOC: Config.cacheSwap
DOC_START
	Usage:

	cache_dir Type Directory-Name Fs-specific-data [options]

	You can specify multiple cache_dir lines to spread the
	cache among different disk partitions.

	Type specifies the kind of storage system to use. Only "ufs"
	is built by default. To enable any of the other storage systems
	see the --enable-storeio configure option.

	'Directory' is a top-level directory where cache swap
	files will be stored.  If you want to use an entire disk
	for caching, this can be the mount-point directory.
	The directory must exist and be writable by the Squid
	process.  Squid will NOT create this directory for you.

	The ufs store type:

	"ufs" is the old well-known Squid storage format that has always
	been there.

	cache_dir ufs Directory-Name Mbytes L1 L2 [options]

	'Mbytes' is the amount of disk space (MB) to use under this
	directory.  The default is 100 MB.  Change this to suit your
	configuration.  Do NOT put the size of your disk drive here.
	Instead, if you want Squid to use the entire disk drive,
	subtract 20% and use that value.

	'Level-1' is the number of first-level subdirectories which
	will be created under the 'Directory'.  The default is 16.

	'Level-2' is the number of second-level subdirectories which
	will be created under each first-level directory.  The default
	is 256.

	The aufs store type:

	"aufs" uses the same storage format as "ufs", utilizing
	POSIX-threads to avoid blocking the main Squid process on
	disk-I/O. This was formerly known in Squid as async-io.

	cache_dir aufs Directory-Name Mbytes L1 L2 [options]

	see argument descriptions under ufs above

	The diskd store type:

	"diskd" uses the same storage format as "ufs", utilizing a
	separate process to avoid blocking the main Squid process on
	disk-I/O.

	cache_dir diskd Directory-Name Mbytes L1 L2 [options] [Q1=n] [Q2=n]

	see argument descriptions under ufs above

	Q1 specifies the number of unacknowledged I/O requests when Squid
	stops opening new files. If this many messages are in the queues,
	Squid won't open new files. Default is 64

	Q2 specifies the number of unacknowledged messages when Squid
	starts blocking.  If this many messages are in the queues,
	Squid blocks until it receives some replies. Default is 72

	When Q1 < Q2 (the default), the cache directory is optimized
	for lower response time at the expense of a decrease in hit
	ratio.  If Q1 > Q2, the cache directory is optimized for
	higher hit ratio at the expense of an increase in response
	time.

	The coss store type:

	block-size=n defines the "block size" for COSS cache_dir's.
	Squid uses file numbers as block numbers.  Since file numbers
	are limited to 24 bits, the block size determines the maximum
	size of the COSS partition.  The default is 512 bytes, which
	leads to a maximum cache_dir size of 512<<24, or 8 GB.  Note
	you should not change the coss block size after Squid
	has written some objects to the cache_dir.

	The coss file store has changed from 2.5. Now it uses a file
	called 'stripe' in the directory names in the config - and
	this will be created by squid -z.

	The null store type:

	no options are allowed or required

	Common options:

	no-store, no new objects should be stored to this cache_dir

	max-size=n, refers to the max object size this storedir supports.
	It is used to initially choose the storedir to dump the object.
	Note: To make optimal use of the max-size limits you should order
	the cache_dir lines with the smallest max-size value first and the
	ones with no max-size specification last.

	Note for coss, max-size must be less than COSS_MEMBUF_SZ,
	which can be changed with the --with-coss-membuf-size=N configure
	option.

	The cache replacement policy parameter determines which

	    lru       : Squid's original list based LRU policy
	    heap GDSF : Greedy-Dual Size Frequency
	    heap LFUDA: Least Frequently Used with Dynamic Aging
	    heap LRU  : LRU policy implemented using a heap

	Applies to any cache_dir lines listed below this.

	The LRU policies keeps recently referenced objects.

	The heap GDSF policy optimizes object hit rate by keeping smaller
	popular objects in cache so it has a better chance of getting a
	hit.  It achieves a lower byte hit rate than LFUDA though since
	it evicts larger (possibly popular) objects.

	The heap LFUDA policy keeps popular objects in cache regardless of
	their size and thus optimizes byte hit rate at the expense of
	hit rate since one large, popular object will prevent many
	smaller, slightly less popular objects from being cached.

	Both policies utilize a dynamic aging mechanism that prevents
	cache pollution that can otherwise occur with frequency-based
	replacement policies.

	NOTE: if using the LFUDA replacement policy you should increase
	the value of maximum_object_size above its default of 4096 KB to
	to maximize the potential byte hit rate improvement of LFUDA.

	For more information about the GDSF and LFUDA cache replacement
	policies see http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/1999/HPL-1999-69.html

	the cache during startup.  Normally this file resides in each
	'cache_dir' directory, but you may specify an alternate
	pathname here.  Note you must give a full filename, not just
	a directory. Since this is the index for the whole object
	list you CANNOT periodically rotate it!

	If %s can be used in the file name it will be replaced with a
	a representation of the cache_dir name where each / is replaced
	with '.'. This is needed to allow adding/removing cache_dir
	lines when cache_swap_log is being used.

	If have more than one 'cache_dir', and %s is not used in the name
	these swap logs will have names such as:

		cache_swap_log.00
		cache_swap_log.01

	Note, the 'squid -k rotate' command normally sends a USR1
	signal to the running squid process.  In certain situations
	(e.g. on Linux with Async I/O), USR1 is used for other

	scheme if basic is the first entry presented, even if more secure
	schemes are presented. For now use the order in the recommended
	settings section below. If other browsers have difficulties (don't
	recognize the schemes offered even if you are using basic) either
	put basic first, or disable the other schemes (by commenting out their
	program entry).

	Once an authentication scheme is fully configured, it can only be
	shutdown by shutting squid down and restarting. Changes can be made on
	the fly and activated with a reconfigure. I.E. You can change to a
	different helper, but not unconfigure the helper completely.

	authentication it does not automatically activate authentication.
	To use authentication you must in addition make use of ACLs based
	on login name in http_access (proxy_auth, proxy_auth_regex or
	external with %LOGIN used in the format tag). The browser will be
	challenged for authentication on the first such acl encountered
	in http_access processing and will also be re-challenged for new
	login credentials if the request is being denied by a proxy_auth
	type acl.

	WARNING: authentication can't be used in a transparently intercepting
	proxy as the client then thinks it is talking to an origin server and
	not the proxy. This is a limitation of bending the TCP/IP protocol to
	transparently intercepting port 80, not a limitation in Squid.

	=== Parameters for the basic scheme follow. ===

	"program" cmdline
	Specify the command for the external authenticator.  Such a program
	reads a line containing "username password" and replies "OK" or
	"ERR" in an endless loop. "ERR" responses may optionally be followed
	by a error description available as %m in the returned error page.
	If you use an authenticator, make sure you have 1 acl of type proxy_auth.

	By default, the basic authentication scheme is not used unless a
	program is specified.

	If you want to use the traditional NCSA proxy authentication, set
	this line to something like

	auth_param basic program @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/libexec/ncsa_auth @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/etc/passwd

	"children" numberofchildren
	The number of authenticator processes to spawn. If you start too few
	Squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog of credential
	verifications, slowing it down. When password verifications are
	done via a (slow) network you are likely to need lots of
	authenticator processes.
	auth_param basic children 5

	"concurrency" concurrency
	The number of concurrent requests the helper can process.
	The default of 0 is used for helpers who only supports
	one request at a time. Setting this changes the protocol used to
	include a channel number first on the request/response line, allowing
	multiple requests to be sent to the same helper in parallell without
	wating for the response.
	Must not be set unless it's known the helper supports this.
	auth_param basic concurrency 0

	"realm" realmstring
	Specifies the realm name which is to be reported to the
	client for the basic proxy authentication scheme (part of
	the text the user will see when prompted their username and
	password). There is no default.
	auth_param basic realm Squid proxy-caching web server

	"credentialsttl" timetolive
	Specifies how long squid assumes an externally validated
	username:password pair is valid for - in other words how
	often the helper program is called for that user. Set this
	low to force revalidation with short lived passwords.  Note
	setting this high does not impact your susceptibility
	to replay attacks unless you are using an one-time password
	system (such as SecureID).  If you are using such a system,
	you will be vulnerable to replay attacks unless you also
	use the max_user_ip ACL in an http_access rule.

	"casesensitive" on|off
	Specifies if usernames are case sensitive. Most user databases are
	case insensitive allowing the same username to be spelled using both
	lower and upper case letters, but some are case sensitive. This
	makes a big difference for user_max_ip ACL processing and similar.
	auth_param basic casesensitive off

	=== Parameters for the digest scheme follow ===

	"program" cmdline
	Specify the command for the external authenticator.  Such
	a program reads a line containing "username":"realm" and
	replies with the appropriate H(A1) value hex encoded or
	ERR if the user (or his H(A1) hash) does not exists.
	See rfc 2616 for the definition of H(A1).
	"ERR" responses may optionally be followed by a error description
	available as %m in the returned error page.

	By default, the digest authentication scheme is not used unless a
	program is specified.

	If you want to use a digest authenticator, set this line to
	something like

	auth_param digest program @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/bin/digest_auth_pw @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/etc/digpass

	"children" numberofchildren
	The number of authenticator processes to spawn (no default).
	If you start too few Squid will have to wait for them to
	process a backlog of H(A1) calculations, slowing it down.
	When the H(A1) calculations are done via a (slow) network
	you are likely to need lots of authenticator processes.
	auth_param digest children 5

	"realm" realmstring
	Specifies the realm name which is to be reported to the
	client for the digest proxy authentication scheme (part of
	the text the user will see when prompted their username and
	password). There is no default.
	auth_param digest realm Squid proxy-caching web server

	"nonce_garbage_interval" timeinterval
	Specifies the interval that nonces that have been issued
	to client_agent's are checked for validity.

	"nonce_max_duration" timeinterval
	Specifies the maximum length of time a given nonce will be
	valid for.

	"nonce_max_count" number
	Specifies the maximum number of times a given nonce can be
	used.

	"nonce_strictness" on|off
	Determines if squid requires strict increment-by-1 behavior
	for nonce counts, or just incrementing (off - for use when
	useragents generate nonce counts that occasionally miss 1
	(ie, 1,2,4,6)). Default off.

	"check_nonce_count" on|off
	This directive if set to off can disable the nonce count check
	completely to work around buggy digest qop implementations in
	certain mainstream browser versions. Default on to check the
	nonce count to protect from authentication replay attacks.

	"post_workaround" on|off
	This is a workaround to certain buggy browsers who sends
	an incorrect request digest in POST requests when reusing
	the same nonce as acquired earlier on a GET request.

	=== NTLM scheme options follow ===

	"program" cmdline
	Specify the command for the external NTLM authenticator.
	Such a program reads exchanged NTLMSSP packets with
	the browser via Squid until authentication is completed.
	If you use an NTLM authenticator, make sure you have 1 acl
	of type proxy_auth.  By default, the NTLM authenticator_program
	is not used.

	auth_param ntlm program @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/bin/ntlm_auth

	"children" numberofchildren
	The number of authenticator processes to spawn (no default).
	If you start too few Squid will have to wait for them to
	process a backlog of credential verifications, slowing it
	down. When credential verifications are done via a (slow)
	network you are likely to need lots of authenticator
	processes.

	auth_param ntlm children 5

	"keep_alive" on|off
	If you experience problems with PUT/POST requests when using the
	Negotiate authentication scheme then you can try setting this to
	off. This will cause Squid to forcibly close the connection on
	the initial requests where the browser asks which schemes are
	supported by the proxy.

	auth_param ntlm keep_alive on

	=== Options for configuring the NEGOTIATE auth-scheme follow ===

	"program" cmdline
	Specify the command for the external Negotiate authenticator.
	This protocol is used in Microsoft Active-Directory enabled setups with
	the Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox browsers.
	Its main purpose is to exchange credentials with the Squid proxy
	using the Kerberos mechanisms.
	If you use a Negotiate authenticator, make sure you have at least one acl
	of type proxy_auth active.  By default, the negotiate authenticator_program
	is not used.
	The only supported program for this role is the ntlm_auth
	program distributed as part of Samba, version 4 or later.

	auth_param negotiate program @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/bin/ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=gss-spnego

	"children" numberofchildren
	The number of authenticator processes to spawn (no default).
	If you start too few Squid will have to wait for them to
	process a backlog of credential verifications, slowing it
	down. When crendential verifications are done via a (slow)
	network you are likely to need lots of authenticator
	processes.
	auth_param negotiate children 5

	"keep_alive" on|off
	If you experience problems with PUT/POST requests when using the
	Negotiate authentication scheme then you can try setting this to

	of the request and optionally followed by additional keywords with
	more details.

	General result syntax:

	  OK/ERR keyword=value ...

	Defined keywords:

	  user=		The users name (login)
	  password=	The users password (for login= cache_peer option)
	  message=	Message describing the reason. Available as %o
	  		in error pages
	  tag=		Apply a tag to a request (for both ERR and OK results)
	  		Only sets a tag, does not alter existing tags.
	  log=		String to be logged in access.log. Available as
	  		%ea in logformat specifications

	If protocol=3.0 (the default) then URL escaping is used to protect
	each value in both requests and responses.

	If using protocol=2.5 then all values need to be enclosed in quotes
	if they may contain whitespace, or the whitespace escaped using \.
	And quotes or \ characters within the keyword value must be \ escaped.

	When using the concurrency= option the protocol is changed by
	introducing a query channel tag infront of the request/response.
	The query channel tag is a number between 0 and concurrency-1.

	'Min' is the time (in minutes) an object without an explicit
	expiry time should be considered fresh. The recommended
	value is 0, any higher values may cause dynamic applications
	to be erroneously cached unless the application designer
	has taken the appropriate actions.

	'Percent' is a percentage of the objects age (time since last
	modification age) an object without explicit expiry time
	will be considered fresh.

	'Max' is an upper limit on how long objects without an explicit
	expiry time will be considered fresh.

	options: override-expire
		 override-lastmod

		standard.  Enabling this feature could make you liable
		for problems which it causes.

		override-lastmod enforces min age even on objects
		that were modified recently.

		reload-into-ims changes client no-cache or ``reload''
		to If-Modified-Since requests. Doing this VIOLATES the
		HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you
		liable for problems which it causes.

		ignore-reload ignores a client no-cache or ``reload''
		header. Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard. Enabling
		this feature could make you liable for problems which
		it causes.

		ignore-no-cache ignores any ``Pragma: no-cache'' and
		``Cache-control: no-cache'' headers received from a server.
		The HTTP RFC never allows the use of this (Pragma) header
		from a server, only a client, though plenty of servers
		send it anyway.

		ignore-no-store ignores any ``Cache-control: no-store''
		headers received from a server. Doing this VIOLATES
		the HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you
		liable for problems which it causes.

		ignore-private ignores any ``Cache-control: private''
		headers received from a server. Doing this VIOLATES
		the HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you

		ignore-auth caches responses to requests with authorization,
		as if the originserver had sent ``Cache-control: public''
		in the response header. Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.
		Enabling this feature could make you liable for problems which
		it causes.

		refresh-ims causes squid to contact the origin server
		when a client issues an If-Modified-Since request. This
		ensures that the client will receive an updated version
		if one is available.

	Basically a cached object is:

		FRESH if expires < now, else STALE
		STALE if age > max
		FRESH if lm-factor < percent, else STALE
		FRESH if age < min
		else STALE

	The refresh_pattern lines are checked in the order listed here.

DOC_START
	Microsoft Internet Explorer up until version 5.5 Service
	Pack 1 has an issue with transparent proxies, wherein it
	is impossible to force a refresh.  Turning this on provides
	a partial fix to the problem, by causing all IMS-REFRESH
	requests from older IE versions to check the origin server
	for fresh content.  This reduces hit ratio by some amount
	(~10% in my experience), but allows users to actually get
	fresh content when they want it.  Note because Squid
	cannot tell if the user is using 5.5 or 5.5SP1, the behavior
	of 5.5 is unchanged from old versions of Squid (i.e. a
	forced refresh is impossible).  Newer versions of IE will,
	hopefully, continue to have the new behavior and will be
	handled based on that assumption.  This option defaults to
	the old Squid behavior, which is better for hit ratios but

DOC_START
	Usage: request_header_access header_name allow|deny [!]aclname ...

	WARNING: Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling
	this feature could make you liable for problems which it
	causes.

	This option replaces the old 'anonymize_headers' and the
	older 'http_anonymizer' option with something that is much
	more configurable. This new method creates a list of ACLs
	for each header, allowing you very fine-tuned header
	mangling.

	This option only applies to request headers, i.e., from the
	client to the server.

	You can only specify known headers for the header name.
	Other headers are reclassified as 'Other'. You can also
	refer to all the headers with 'All'.

	For example, to achieve the same behavior as the old
	'http_anonymizer standard' option, you should use:

		request_header_access From deny all

	Usage: reply_header_access header_name allow|deny [!]aclname ...

	WARNING: Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling
	this feature could make you liable for problems which it
	causes.

	This option only applies to reply headers, i.e., from the
	server to the client.

	This is the same as request_header_access, but in the other
	direction.

	This option replaces the old 'anonymize_headers' and the
	older 'http_anonymizer' option with something that is much
	more configurable. This new method creates a list of ACLs
	for each header, allowing you very fine-tuned header
	mangling.

	You can only specify known headers for the header name.
	Other headers are reclassified as 'Other'. You can also
	refer to all the headers with 'All'.

	For example, to achieve the same behavior as the old
	'http_anonymizer standard' option, you should use:

		reply_header_access From deny all
		reply_header_access Referer deny all
		reply_header_access Server deny all
		reply_header_access User-Agent deny all
		reply_header_access WWW-Authenticate deny all
		reply_header_access Link deny all

	The maximum amount of time a client (browser) is allowed to
	remain connected to the cache process.  This protects the Cache
	from having a lot of sockets (and hence file descriptors) tied up
	in a CLOSE_WAIT state from remote clients that go away without
	properly shutting down (either because of a network failure or
	because of a poor client implementation).  The default is one
	day, 1440 minutes.

	NOTE:  The default value is intended to be much larger than any
	client would ever need to be connected to your cache.  You
	should probably change client_lifetime only as a last resort.
	If you seem to have many client connections tying up
	filedescriptors, we recommend first tuning the read_timeout,

LOC: Config.maxReplyHeaderSize
DOC_START
	This specifies the maximum size for HTTP headers in a reply.
	Reply headers are usually relatively small (about 512 bytes).
	Placing a limit on the reply header size will catch certain
	bugs (for example with persistent connections) and possibly
	buffer-overflow or denial-of-service attacks.
DOC_END

NAME: reply_body_max_size
COMMENT: size [acl acl...]
TYPE: acl_b_size_t
DEFAULT: none
LOC: Config.ReplyBodySize
DOC_START
	This option specifies the maximum size of a reply body. It can be
	used to prevent users from downloading very large files, such as
	MP3's and movies. When the reply headers are received, the
	reply_body_max_size lines are processed, and the first line where
	all (if any) listed ACLs are true is used as the maximum body size
	for this reply.

	This size is checked twice. First when we get the reply headers,
	we check the content-length value.  If the content length value exists
	and is larger than the allowed size, the request is denied and the
	user receives an error message that says "the request or reply
	is too large." If there is no content-length, and the reply
	size exceeds this limit, the client's connection is just closed
	and they will receive a partial reply.

	WARNING: downstream caches probably can not detect a partial reply
	if there is no content-length header, so they will cache
	partial responses and give them out as hits.  You should NOT
	use this option if you have downstream caches.

	WARNING: A maximum size smaller than the size of squid's error messages
	will cause an infinite loop and crash squid. Ensure that the smallest
	non-zero value you use is greater that the maximum header size plus
	the size of your largest error page.

	If you set this parameter none (the default), there will be
	no limit imposed.

	have a total of 2 delay pools.
DOC_END

NAME: delay_class
TYPE: delay_pool_class
DEFAULT: none
IFDEF: DELAY_POOLS
LOC: Config.Delay
DOC_START
	This defines the class of each delay pool.  There must be exactly one
	delay_class line for each delay pool.  For example, to define two
	delay pools, one of class 2 and one of class 3, the settings above
	and here would be:

Example:
 delay_pools 4      # 4 delay pools
 delay_class 1 2    # pool 1 is a class 2 pool
 delay_class 2 3    # pool 2 is a class 3 pool
 delay_class 3 4    # pool 3 is a class 4 pool
 delay_class 4 5    # pool 4 is a class 5 pool

	The delay pool classes are:

		class 1		Everything is limited by a single aggregate
				bucket.

		class 2 	Everything is limited by a single aggregate
				bucket as well as an "individual" bucket chosen
				from bits 25 through 32 of the IP address.

		class 3		Everything is limited by a single aggregate
				bucket as well as a "network" bucket chosen
				from bits 17 through 24 of the IP address and a
				"individual" bucket chosen from bits 17 through
				32 of the IP address.

		class 4		Everything in a class 3 delay pool, with an
				additional limit on a per user basis. This
				only takes effect if the username is established
				in advance - by forcing authentication in your
				http_access rules.

		class 5		Requests are grouped according their tag (see
				external_acl's tag= reply).

	NOTE: If an IP address is a.b.c.d
		-> bits 25 through 32 are "d"
		-> bits 17 through 24 are "c"
		-> bits 17 through 32 are "c * 256 + d"

NAME: delay_access

	This is used to determine which delay pool a request falls into.

	delay_access is sorted per pool and the matching starts with pool 1,
	then pool 2, ..., and finally pool N. The first delay pool where the
	request is allowed is selected for the request. If it does not allow
	the request to any pool then the request is not delayed (default).

	For example, if you want some_big_clients in delay
	pool 1 and lotsa_little_clients in delay pool 2:

Example:
 delay_access 1 allow some_big_clients
 delay_access 1 deny all
 delay_access 2 allow lotsa_little_clients
 delay_access 2 deny all
 delay_access 3 allow authenticated_clients
DOC_END

NAME: delay_parameters
TYPE: delay_pool_rates
DEFAULT: none
IFDEF: DELAY_POOLS
LOC: Config.Delay
DOC_START
	This defines the parameters for a delay pool.  Each delay pool has
	a number of "buckets" associated with it, as explained in the
	description of delay_class.  For a class 1 delay pool, the syntax is:

delay_parameters pool aggregate

	For a class 2 delay pool:

delay_parameters pool aggregate individual

	For a class 3 delay pool:

delay_parameters pool aggregate network individual

	For a class 4 delay pool:

delay_parameters pool aggregate network individual user

	For a class 5 delay pool:

delay_parameters pool tag

	The variables here are:

		pool		a pool number - ie, a number between 1 and the
				number specified in delay_pools as used in
				delay_class lines.

		aggregate	the "delay parameters" for the aggregate bucket
				(class 1, 2, 3).

		individual	the "delay parameters" for the individual
				buckets (class 2, 3).

		network		the "delay parameters" for the network buckets
				(class 3).

		user		the delay parameters for the user buckets
				(class 4).

		tag		the delay parameters for the tag buckets
				(class 5).

	A pair of delay parameters is written restore/maximum, where restore is
	the number of bytes (not bits - modem and network speeds are usually
	quoted in bits) per second placed into the bucket, and maximum is the
	maximum number of bytes which can be in the bucket at any time.

	For example, if delay pool number 1 is a class 2 delay pool as in the
	above example, and is being used to strictly limit each host to 64kbps
	(plus overheads), with no overall limit, the line is:

delay_parameters 1 -1/-1 8000/8000

	Note that the figure -1 is used to represent "unlimited".

	And, if delay pool number 2 is a class 3 delay pool as in the above
	example, and you want to limit it to a total of 256kbps (strict limit)
	with each 8-bit network permitted 64kbps (strict limit) and each
	individual host permitted 4800bps with a bucket maximum size of 64kb
	to permit a decent web page to be downloaded at a decent speed
	(if the network is not being limited due to overuse) but slow down
	large downloads more significantly:

delay_parameters 2 32000/32000 8000/8000 600/8000

	There must be one delay_parameters line for each delay pool.

	Finally, for a class 4 delay pool as in the example - each user will
	be limited to 128Kb no matter how many workstations they are logged into.:

delay_parameters 4 32000/32000 8000/8000 600/64000 16000/16000

	denied access. The exceptions to this rule are:
	- When Squid needs to request authentication credentials. It's then
	  the first authentication related acl encountered
	- When none of the http_access lines matches. It's then the last
	  acl processed on the last http_access line.

 OPTIONS INFLUENCING REQUEST FORWARDING 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENT_END

NAME: nonhierarchical_direct
TYPE: onoff
LOC: Config.onoff.nonhierarchical_direct
DEFAULT: on
DOC_START
	By default, Squid will send any non-hierarchical requests
	(matching hierarchy_stoplist or not cacheable request type) direct
	to origin servers.

	If you set this to off, Squid will prefer to send these
	requests to parents.

	Note that in most configurations, by turning this off you will only
	add latency to these request without any improvement in global hit
	ratio.

	If you are inside an firewall see never_direct instead of
	this directive.
DOC_END

NAME: prefer_direct
TYPE: onoff
LOC: Config.onoff.prefer_direct
DEFAULT: off
DOC_START
	Normally Squid tries to use parents for most requests. If you for some
	reason like it to first try going direct and only use a parent if
	going direct fails set this to on.

	By combining nonhierarchical_direct off and prefer_direct on you
	can set up Squid to use a parent as a backup path if going direct
	fails.

	Note: If you want Squid to use parents for all requests see
	the never_direct directive. prefer_direct only modifies how Squid
	acts on cacheable requests.
DOC_END

NAME: always_direct
TYPE: acl_access
LOC: Config.accessList.AlwaysDirect
DEFAULT: none
DOC_START
	Usage: always_direct allow|deny [!]aclname ...

	Here you can use ACL elements to specify requests which should
	ALWAYS be forwarded by Squid to the origin servers without using
	any peers.  For example, to always directly forward requests for
	local servers ignoring any parents or siblings you may have use
	something like:

		acl local-servers dstdomain my.domain.net
		always_direct allow local-servers

	To always forward FTP requests directly, use

		acl FTP proto FTP
		always_direct allow FTP

	NOTE: There is a similar, but opposite option named
	'never_direct'.  You need to be aware that "always_direct deny
	foo" is NOT the same thing as "never_direct allow foo".  You
	may need to use a deny rule to exclude a more-specific case of
	some other rule.  Example:

		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
		acl local-servers dstdomain  .foo.net
		always_direct deny local-external
		always_direct allow local-servers

	NOTE: If your goal is to make the client forward the request
	directly to the origin server bypassing Squid then this needs
	to be done in the client configuration. Squid configuration
	can only tell Squid how Squid should fetch the object.

	NOTE: This directive is not related to caching. The replies
	is cached as usual even if you use always_direct. To not cache
	the replies see no_cache.

	This option replaces some v1.1 options such as local_domain
	and local_ip.
DOC_END

NAME: never_direct
TYPE: acl_access
LOC: Config.accessList.NeverDirect
DEFAULT: none
DOC_START
	Usage: never_direct allow|deny [!]aclname ...

	never_direct is the opposite of always_direct.  Please read
	the description for always_direct if you have not already.

	With 'never_direct' you can use ACL elements to specify
	requests which should NEVER be forwarded directly to origin
	servers.  For example, to force the use of a proxy for all
	requests, except those in your local domain use something like:

		acl local-servers dstdomain .foo.net
		acl all src 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
		never_direct deny local-servers
		never_direct allow all

	or if Squid is inside a firewall and there are local intranet
	servers inside the firewall use something like:

		acl local-intranet dstdomain .foo.net
		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
		always_direct deny local-external
		always_direct allow local-intranet
		never_direct allow all

	This option replaces some v1.1 options such as inside_firewall
	and firewall_ip.

	/etc/resolv.conf file.
	On Windows platforms, if no value is specified here or in
	the /etc/resolv.conf file, the list of DNS name servers are
	taken from the Windows registry, both static and dynamic DHCP

	default locations:
	- Un*X & Linux:    /etc/hosts
	- Windows NT/2000: %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
			   (%SystemRoot% value install default is c:\winnt)

	The file contains newline-separated definitions, in the
	form ip_address_in_dotted_form name [name ...] names are
	whitespace-separated. Lines beginning with an hash (#)
	character are comments.

	The file is checked at startup and upon configuration.
	If set to 'none', it won't be checked.
	If append_domain is used, that domain will be added to
	domain-local (i.e. not containing any dot character) host
	definitions.

NAME: memory_pools
COMMENT: on|off
TYPE: onoff
DEFAULT: on
LOC: Config.onoff.mem_pools
DOC_START
	If set, Squid will keep pools of allocated (but unused) memory
	available for future use.  If memory is a premium on your
	system and you believe your malloc library outperforms Squid
	routines, disable this.
DOC_END

NAME: memory_pools_limit
COMMENT: (bytes)
TYPE: b_size_t
DEFAULT: 5 MB
LOC: Config.MemPools.limit
DOC_START
	Used only with memory_pools on:
	memory_pools_limit 50 MB

	If set to a non-zero value, Squid will keep at most the specified
	limit of allocated (but unused) memory in memory pools. All free()
	requests that exceed this limit will be handled by your malloc
	library. Squid does not pre-allocate any memory, just safe-keeps
	objects that otherwise would be free()d. Thus, it is safe to set
	memory_pools_limit to a reasonably high value even if your
	configuration will use less memory.

	If set to zero, Squid will keep all memory it can. That is, there
	will be no limit on the total amount of memory used for safe-keeping.

	To disable memory allocation optimization, do not set
	memory_pools_limit to 0. Set memory_pools to "off" instead.

	An overhead for maintaining memory pools is not taken into account
	when the limit is checked. This overhead is close to four bytes per
	object kept. However, pools may actually _save_ memory because of
	reduced memory thrashing in your malloc library.

NAME: refresh_all_ims
COMMENT: on|off
TYPE: onoff
DEFAULT: off
LOC: Config.onoff.refresh_all_ims
DOC_START
	When you enable this option, squid will always check
	the origin server for an update when a client sends an
	If-Modified-Since request.  Many browsers use IMS
	requests when the user requests a reload, and this
	ensures those clients receive the latest version.

	By default (off), squid may return a Not Modified response
	based on the age of the cached version.
DOC_END

NAME: reload_into_ims

TYPE: onoff
DEFAULT: off
LOC: Config.onoff.reload_into_ims
DOC_START
	When you enable this option, client no-cache or ``reload''
	requests will be changed to If-Modified-Since requests.
	Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling this
	feature could make you liable for problems which it
	causes.

	see also refresh_pattern for a more selective approach.

NAME: maximum_single_addr_tries
TYPE: int
LOC: Config.retry.maxtries
DEFAULT: 1
DOC_START
	This sets the maximum number of connection attempts for a
	host that only has one address (for multiple-address hosts,
	each address is tried once).

	The default value is one attempt, the (not recommended)
	maximum is 255 tries.  A warning message will be generated
	if it is set to a value greater than ten.

	Note: This is in addition to the request re-forwarding which
	takes place if Squid fails to get a satisfying response.
DOC_END

NAME: retry_on_error
TYPE: onoff
LOC: Config.retry.onerror
DEFAULT: off
DOC_START
	If set to on Squid will automatically retry requests when

	control errors.
DOC_END

NAME: as_whois_server

NAME: uri_whitespace
TYPE: uri_whitespace
LOC: Config.uri_whitespace
DEFAULT: strip
DOC_START
	What to do with requests that have whitespace characters in the
	URI.  Options:

	strip:  The whitespace characters are stripped out of the URL.
		This is the behavior recommended by RFC2396.
	deny:   The request is denied.  The user receives an "Invalid
		Request" message.
	allow:  The request is allowed and the URI is not changed.  The
		whitespace characters remain in the URI.  Note the
		whitespace is passed to redirector processes if they
		are in use.
	encode:	The request is allowed and the whitespace characters are
		encoded according to RFC1738.  This could be considered
		a violation of the HTTP/1.1
		RFC because proxies are not allowed to rewrite URI's.
	chop:	The request is allowed and the URI is chopped at the
		first whitespace.  This might also be considered a
		violation.

NAME: coredump_dir
TYPE: string
LOC: Config.coredump_dir
DEFAULT: none
DEFAULT_IF_NONE: none
DOC_START
	By default Squid leaves core files in the directory from where
	it was started. If you set 'coredump_dir' to a directory
	that exists, Squid will chdir() to that directory at startup
	and coredump files will be left there.

NAME: redirector_bypass
TYPE: onoff
LOC: Config.onoff.redirector_bypass
DEFAULT: off
DOC_START
	When this is 'on', a request will not go through the
	redirector if all redirectors are busy.  If this is 'off'
	and the redirector queue grows too large, Squid will exit
	with a FATAL error and ask you to increase the number of
	redirectors.  You should only enable this if the redirectors
	are not critical to your caching system.  If you use
	redirectors for access control, and you enable this option,
	users may have access to pages they should not
	be allowed to request.
DOC_END

NAME: chroot
TYPE: string
LOC: Config.chroot_dir
DEFAULT: none
DOC_START
	Use this to have Squid do a chroot() while initializing.  This
	also causes Squid to fully drop root privileges after
	initializing.  This means, for example, if you use a HTTP
	port less than 1024 and try to reconfigure, you will may get an
	error saying that Squid can not open the port.
DOC_END

NAME: balance_on_multiple_ip
TYPE: onoff
LOC: Config.onoff.balance_on_multiple_ip
DEFAULT: on
DOC_START
	Some load balancing servers based on round robin DNS have been
	found not to preserve user session state across requests
	to different IP addresses.

	By default Squid rotates IP's per request. By disabling
	this directive only connection failure triggers rotation.
DOC_END

NAME: pipeline_prefetch
TYPE: onoff
LOC: Config.onoff.pipeline_prefetch
DEFAULT: off
DOC_START
	To boost the performance of pipelined requests to closer

LOC: Config.sleep_after_fork
DEFAULT: 0
DOC_START
	When this is set to a non-zero value, the main Squid process
	sleeps the specified number of microseconds after a fork()
	system call. This sleep may help the situation where your
	system reports fork() failures due to lack of (virtual)
	memory. Note, however, if you have a lot of child
	processes, these sleep delays will add up and your
	Squid will not service requests for some amount of time
	until all the child processes have been started.
	On Windows value less then 1000 (1 milliseconds) are
	rounded to 1000.
