COMMENT_START
	WELCOME TO @SQUID@
	----------------------------
	
	This is the documentation for the Squid configuration file.
	This documentation can also be found online at:
		http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/
	
	You may wish to look at the Squid home page and wiki for the
	FAQ and other documentation:
		http://www.squid-cache.org/
		http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq
		http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples
	
	This documentation shows what the defaults for various directives
	happen to be.  If you don't need to change the default, you should
	leave the line out of your squid.conf in most cases.
	
	In some cases "none" refers to no default setting at all,
	while in other cases it refers to the value of the option
	- the comments for that keyword indicate if this is the case.

COMMENT_END

COMMENT_START
  Configuration options can be included using the "include" directive.
  Include takes a list of files to include. Quoting and wildcards are
  supported.

  For example,

  include /path/to/included/file/squid.acl.config

  Includes can be nested up to a hard-coded depth of 16 levels.
  This arbitrary restriction is to prevent recursive include references
  from causing Squid entering an infinite loop whilst trying to load
  configuration files.

  Values with byte units

	Squid accepts size units on some size related directives. All
	such directives are documented with a default value displaying
	a unit.

	Units accepted by Squid are:
		bytes - byte
		KB - Kilobyte (1024 bytes)
		MB - Megabyte
		GB - Gigabyte

  Values with time units

	Time-related directives marked with either "time-units" or
	"time-units-small" accept a time unit. The supported time units are:

		nanosecond (time-units-small only)
		microsecond (time-units-small only)
		millisecond
		second
		minute
		hour
		day
		week
		fortnight
		month - 30 days
		year - 31557790080 milliseconds (just over 365 days)
		decade

  Values with spaces, quotes, and other special characters

	Squid supports directive parameters with spaces, quotes, and other
	special characters. Surround such parameters with "double quotes". Use
	the configuration_includes_quoted_values directive to enable or
	disable that support.

	Squid supports reading configuration option parameters from external
	files using the syntax:
		parameters("/path/filename")
	For example:
		acl whitelist dstdomain parameters("/etc/squid/whitelist.txt")

  Conditional configuration

	If-statements can be used to make configuration directives
	depend on conditions:

	    if <CONDITION>
	        ... regular configuration directives ...
	    [else
	        ... regular configuration directives ...]
	    endif

	The else part is optional. The keywords "if", "else", and "endif"
	must be typed on their own lines, as if they were regular
	configuration directives.

	NOTE: An else-if condition is not supported.

	These individual conditions types are supported:

	    true
		Always evaluates to true.
	    false
		Always evaluates to false.
	    <integer> = <integer>
	        Equality comparison of two integer numbers.


  SMP-Related Macros

	The following SMP-related preprocessor macros can be used.

	${process_name} expands to the current Squid process "name"
	(e.g., squid1, squid2, or cache1).

	${process_number} expands to the current Squid process
	identifier, which is an integer number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) unique
	across all Squid processes of the current service instance.

	${service_name} expands into the current Squid service instance
	name identifier which is provided by -n on the command line.

  Logformat Macros

	Logformat macros can be used in many places outside of the logformat
	directive. In theory, all of the logformat codes can be used as %macros,
	where they are supported. In practice, a %macro expands as a dash (-) when
	the transaction does not yet have enough information and a value is needed.

	There is no definitive list of what tokens are available at the various
	stages of the transaction.

	And some information may already be available to Squid but not yet
	committed where the macro expansion code can access it (report
	such instances!). The macro will be expanded into a single dash
	('-') in such cases. Not all macros have been tested.

NAME: shared_memory_locking
TYPE: YesNoNone
COMMENT: on|off
LOC: Config.shmLocking
DEFAULT: off
DOC_START
	Whether to ensure that all required shared memory is available by
	"locking" that shared memory into RAM when Squid starts. The
	alternative is faster startup time followed by slightly slower
	performance and, if not enough RAM is actually available during
	runtime, mysterious crashes.

	SMP Squid uses many shared memory segments. These segments are
	brought into Squid memory space using an mmap(2) system call. During
	Squid startup, the mmap() call often succeeds regardless of whether
	the system has enough RAM. In general, Squid cannot tell whether the
	kernel applies this "optimistic" memory allocation policy (but
	popular modern kernels usually use it).

	Later, if Squid attempts to actually access the mapped memory
	regions beyond what the kernel is willing to allocate, the
	"optimistic" kernel simply kills Squid kid with a SIGBUS signal.
	Some of the memory limits enforced by the kernel are currently
	poorly understood: We do not know how to detect and check them. This
	option ensures that the mapped memory will be available. 

	This option may have a positive performance side-effect: Locking
	memory at start avoids runtime paging I/O. Paging slows Squid down.

	Locking memory may require a large enough RLIMIT_MEMLOCK OS limit,
	CAP_IPC_LOCK capability, or equivalent.
DOC_END

NAME: hopeless_kid_revival_delay
COMMENT: time-units
TYPE: time_t
LOC: Config.hopelessKidRevivalDelay
DEFAULT: 1 hour
DOC_START
	Normally, when a kid process dies, Squid immediately restarts the
	kid. A kid experiencing frequent deaths is marked as "hopeless" for
	the duration specified by this directive. Hopeless kids are not
	automatically restarted.

	Currently, zero values are not supported because they result in
	misconfigured SMP Squid instances running forever, endlessly
	restarting each dying kid. To effectively disable hopeless kids
	revival, set the delay to a huge value (e.g., 1 year).

	Reconfiguration also clears all hopeless kids designations, allowing
	for manual revival of hopeless kids.

COMMENT_START
 OPTIONS FOR AUTHENTICATION
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENT_END

NAME: auth_param
TYPE: authparam
IFDEF: USE_AUTH
LOC: Auth::TheConfig.schemes
DEFAULT: none
DOC_START
	This is used to define parameters for the various authentication
	schemes supported by Squid.

		format: auth_param scheme parameter [setting]

	The order in which authentication schemes are presented to the client is
	dependent on the order the scheme first appears in config file. IE
	has a bug (it's not RFC 2617 compliant) in that it will use the basic
	scheme if basic is the first entry presented, even if more secure
	schemes are presented. For now use the order in the recommended
	settings section below. If other browsers have difficulties (don't
	recognize the schemes offered even if you are using basic) either
	put basic first, or disable the other schemes (by commenting out their
	program entry).

	Once an authentication scheme is fully configured, it can only be
	shutdown by shutting squid down and restarting. Changes can be made on
	the fly and activated with a reconfigure. I.E. You can change to a
	different helper, but not unconfigure the helper completely.

	Please note that while this directive defines how Squid processes
	authentication it does not automatically activate authentication.
	To use authentication you must in addition make use of ACLs based
	on login name in http_access (proxy_auth, proxy_auth_regex or
	external with %LOGIN used in the format tag). The browser will be
	challenged for authentication on the first such acl encountered
	in http_access processing and will also be re-challenged for new
	login credentials if the request is being denied by a proxy_auth
	type acl.

	WARNING: authentication can't be used in a transparently intercepting
	proxy as the client then thinks it is talking to an origin server and
	not the proxy. This is a limitation of bending the TCP/IP protocol to
	transparently intercepting port 80, not a limitation in Squid.
	Ports flagged 'transparent', 'intercept', or 'tproxy' have
	authentication disabled.

	=== Parameters common to all schemes. ===

	"program" cmdline
		Specifies the command for the external authenticator.

		By default, each authentication scheme is not used unless a
		program is specified.

		See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/AddonHelpers for
		more details on helper operations and creating your own.

	"key_extras" format
		Specifies a string to be append to request line format for
		the authentication helper. "Quoted" format values may contain
		spaces and logformat %macros. In theory, any logformat %macro
		can be used. In practice, a %macro expands as a dash (-) if
		the helper request is sent before the required macro
		information is available to Squid.

		By default, Squid uses request formats provided in
		scheme-specific examples below (search for %credentials).

		The expanded key_extras value is added to the Squid credentials
		cache and, hence, will affect authentication. It can be used to
		autenticate different users with identical user names (e.g.,
		when user authentication depends on http_port).

		Avoid adding frequently changing information to key_extras. For
		example, if you add user source IP, and it changes frequently
		in your environment, then max_user_ip ACL is going to treat
		every user+IP combination as a unique "user", breaking the ACL
		and wasting a lot of memory on those user records. It will also
		force users to authenticate from scratch whenever their IP
		changes.

	"realm" string
		Specifies the protection scope (aka realm name) which is to be
		reported to the client for the authentication scheme. It is
		commonly part of the text the user will see when prompted for
		their username and password.

		For Basic the default is "Squid proxy-caching web server".
		For Digest there is no default, this parameter is mandatory.
		For NTLM and Negotiate this parameter is ignored.

	"children" numberofchildren [startup=N] [idle=N] [concurrency=N]
		[queue-size=N] [on-persistent-overload=action]
		[reservation-timeout=seconds]

		The maximum number of authenticator processes to spawn. If
		you start too few Squid will have to wait for them to process
		a backlog of credential verifications, slowing it down. When
		password verifications are done via a (slow) network you are
		likely to need lots of authenticator processes.

		The startup= and idle= options permit some skew in the exact
		amount run. A minimum of startup=N will begin during startup
		and reconfigure. Squid will start more in groups of up to
		idle=N in an attempt to meet traffic needs and to keep idle=N
		free above those traffic needs up to the maximum.

		The concurrency= option sets the number of concurrent requests
		the helper can process.  The default of 0 is used for helpers
		who only supports one request at a time. Setting this to a
		number greater than 0 changes the protocol used to include a
		channel ID field first on the request/response line, allowing
		multiple requests to be sent to the same helper in parallel
		without waiting for the response.

		Concurrency must not be set unless it's known the helper
		supports the input format with channel-ID fields.

		The queue-size option sets the maximum number of queued
		requests. A request is queued when no existing child can
		accept it due to concurrency limit and no new child can be
		started due to numberofchildren limit. The default maximum is
		2*numberofchildren. Squid is allowed to temporarily exceed the
		configured maximum, marking the affected helper as
		"overloaded". If the helper overload lasts more than 3
		minutes, the action prescribed by the on-persistent-overload
		option applies.

		The on-persistent-overload=action option specifies Squid
		reaction to a new helper request arriving when the helper
		has been overloaded for more that 3 minutes already. The number
		of queued requests determines whether the helper is overloaded
		(see the queue-size option).

		Two actions are supported:

		  die	Squid worker quits. This is the default behavior.

		  ERR	Squid treats the helper request as if it was
			immediately submitted, and the helper immediately
			replied with an ERR response. This action has no effect
			on the already queued and in-progress helper requests.

		NOTE: NTLM and Negotiate schemes do not support concurrency
			in the Squid code module even though some helpers can.

		The reservation-timeout=seconds option allows NTLM and Negotiate
		helpers to forget about clients that abandon their in-progress
		connection authentication without closing the connection. The
		timeout is measured since the last helper response received by
		Squid for the client. Fractional seconds are not supported.

		After the timeout, the helper will be used for other clients if
		there are no unreserved helpers available. In the latter case,
		the old client attempt to resume authentication will not be
		forwarded to the helper (and the client should open a new HTTP
		connection and retry authentication from scratch).

		By default, reservations do not expire and clients that keep
		their connections open without completing authentication may
		exhaust all NTLM and Negotiate helpers.

	"keep_alive" on|off
		If you experience problems with PUT/POST requests when using
		the NTLM or Negotiate schemes then you can try setting this
		to off. This will cause Squid to forcibly close the connection
		on the initial request where the browser asks which schemes
		are supported by the proxy.

		For Basic and Digest this parameter is ignored.

	"utf8" on|off
		Useful for sending credentials to authentication backends that
		expect UTF-8 encoding (e.g., LDAP).

		When this option is enabled, Squid uses HTTP Accept-Language
		request header to guess the received credentials encoding
		(ISO-Latin-1, CP1251, or UTF-8) and then converts the first
		two encodings into UTF-8.

		When this option is disabled and by default, Squid sends
		credentials in their original (i.e. received) encoding.

		This parameter is only honored for Basic and Digest schemes.
		For Basic, the entire username:password credentials are
		checked and, if necessary, re-encoded. For Digest -- just the
		username component. For NTLM and Negotiate schemes, this
		parameter is ignored.

IF HAVE_AUTH_MODULE_BASIC
	=== Basic authentication parameters ===

	"credentialsttl" timetolive
		Specifies how long squid assumes an externally validated
		username:password pair is valid for - in other words how
		often the helper program is called for that user. Set this
		low to force revalidation with short lived passwords.

		NOTE: setting this high does not impact your susceptibility
		to replay attacks unless you are using an one-time password
		system (such as SecureID). If you are using such a system,
		you will be vulnerable to replay attacks unless you also
		use the max_user_ip ACL in an http_access rule.

	"casesensitive" on|off
		Specifies if usernames are case sensitive. Most user databases
		are case insensitive allowing the same username to be spelled
		using both lower and upper case letters, but some are case
		sensitive. This makes a big difference for user_max_ip ACL
		processing and similar.

ENDIF
IF HAVE_AUTH_MODULE_DIGEST
	=== Digest authentication parameters ===

	"nonce_garbage_interval" timeinterval
		Specifies the interval that nonces that have been issued
		to client_agent's are checked for validity.

	"nonce_max_duration" timeinterval
		Specifies the maximum length of time a given nonce will be
		valid for.

	"nonce_max_count" number
		Specifies the maximum number of times a given nonce can be
		used.

	"nonce_strictness" on|off
		Determines if squid requires strict increment-by-1 behavior
		for nonce counts, or just incrementing (off - for use when
		user agents generate nonce counts that occasionally miss 1
		(ie, 1,2,4,6)). Default off.

	"check_nonce_count" on|off
		This directive if set to off can disable the nonce count check
		completely to work around buggy digest qop implementations in
		certain mainstream browser versions. Default on to check the
		nonce count to protect from authentication replay attacks.

	"post_workaround" on|off
		This is a workaround to certain buggy browsers who send an
		incorrect request digest in POST requests when reusing the
		same nonce as acquired earlier on a GET request.

NAME: external_acl_type
TYPE: externalAclHelper
LOC: Config.externalAclHelperList
DEFAULT: none
DOC_START
	This option defines external acl classes using a helper program
	to look up the status

	  external_acl_type name [options] FORMAT /path/to/helper [helper arguments]

	Options:

	  ttl=n		TTL in seconds for cached results (defaults to 3600
			for 1 hour)

	  negative_ttl=n
			TTL for cached negative lookups (default same
			as ttl)

	  grace=n	Percentage remaining of TTL where a refresh of a
			cached entry should be initiated without needing to
			wait for a new reply. (default is for no grace period)

	  cache=n	The maximum number of entries in the result cache. The
			default limit is 262144 entries.  Each cache entry usually
			consumes at least 256 bytes. Squid currently does not remove
			expired cache entries until the limit is reached, so a proxy
			will sooner or later reach the limit. The expanded FORMAT
			value is used as the cache key, so if the details in FORMAT
			are highly variable, a larger cache may be needed to produce
			reduction in helper load.

	  children-max=n
			Maximum number of acl helper processes spawned to service
			external acl lookups of this type. (default 5)

	  children-startup=n
			Minimum number of acl helper processes to spawn during
			startup and reconfigure to service external acl lookups
			of this type. (default 0)

	  children-idle=n
			Number of acl helper processes to keep ahead of traffic
			loads. Squid will spawn this many at once whenever load
			rises above the capabilities of existing processes.
			Up to the value of children-max. (default 1)

	  concurrency=n	concurrency level per process. Only used with helpers
			capable of processing more than one query at a time.

	  queue-size=N  The queue-size option sets the maximum number of
			queued requests. A request is queued when no existing
			helper can accept it due to concurrency limit and no
			new helper can be started due to children-max limit.
			If the queued requests exceed queue size, the acl is
			ignored. The default value is set to 2*children-max.

	  protocol=2.5	Compatibility mode for Squid-2.5 external acl helpers.

	  ipv4 / ipv6	IP protocol used to communicate with this helper.
			The default is to auto-detect IPv6 and use it when available.


	FORMAT is a series of %macro codes. See logformat directive for a full list
	of the accepted codes. Although note that at the time of any external ACL
	being tested data may not be available and thus some %macro expand to '-'.

	In addition to the logformat codes; when processing external ACLs these
	additional macros are made available:

	  %ACL		The name of the ACL being tested.

	  %DATA		The ACL arguments specified in the referencing config
			'acl ... external' line, separated by spaces (an
			"argument string"). see acl external.

			If there are no ACL arguments %DATA expands to '-'.

			If you do not specify a DATA macro inside FORMAT,
			Squid automatically appends %DATA to your FORMAT.
			Note that Squid-3.x may expand %DATA to whitespace
			or nothing in this case.

			By default, Squid applies URL-encoding to each ACL
			argument inside the argument string. If an explicit
			encoding modifier is used (e.g., %#DATA), then Squid
			encodes the whole argument string as a single token
			(e.g., with %#DATA, spaces between arguments become
			%20).

	If SSL is enabled, the following formating codes become available:

	  %USER_CERT		SSL User certificate in PEM format
	  %USER_CERTCHAIN	SSL User certificate chain in PEM format
	  %USER_CERT_xx		SSL User certificate subject attribute xx
	  %USER_CA_CERT_xx	SSL User certificate issuer attribute xx


	NOTE: all other format codes accepted by older Squid versions
		are deprecated.


	General request syntax:

	  [channel-ID] FORMAT-values


	FORMAT-values consists of transaction details expanded with
	whitespace separation per the config file FORMAT specification
	using the FORMAT macros listed above.

	Request values sent to the helper are URL escaped to protect
	each value in requests against whitespaces.

	If using protocol=2.5 then the request sent to the helper is not
	URL escaped to protect against whitespace.

	NOTE: protocol=3.0 is deprecated as no longer necessary.

	When using the concurrency= option the protocol is changed by
	introducing a query channel tag in front of the request/response.
	The query channel tag is a number between 0 and concurrency-1.
	This value must be echoed back unchanged to Squid as the first part
	of the response relating to its request.


	The helper receives lines expanded per the above format specification
	and for each input line returns 1 line starting with OK/ERR/BH result
	code and optionally followed by additional keywords with more details.


	General result syntax:

	  [channel-ID] result keyword=value ...

	Result consists of one of the codes:

	  OK
		the ACL test produced a match.

	  ERR
		the ACL test does not produce a match.

	  BH
		An internal error occurred in the helper, preventing
		a result being identified.

	The meaning of 'a match' is determined by your squid.conf
	access control configuration. See the Squid wiki for details.

	Defined keywords:

	  user=		The users name (login)

	  password=	The users password (for login= cache_peer option)

	  message=	Message describing the reason for this response.
			Available as %o in error pages.
			Useful on (ERR and BH results).

	  tag=		Apply a tag to a request. Only sets a tag once,
			does not alter existing tags.

	  log=		String to be logged in access.log. Available as
			%ea in logformat specifications.

	  clt_conn_tag= Associates a TAG with the client TCP connection.
			Please see url_rewrite_program related documentation
			for this kv-pair.

	Any keywords may be sent on any response whether OK, ERR or BH.

	All response keyword values need to be a single token with URL
	escaping, or enclosed in double quotes (") and escaped using \ on
	any double quotes or \ characters within the value. The wrapping
	double quotes are removed before the value is interpreted by Squid.
	\r and \n are also replace by CR and LF.

	Some example key values:

		user=John%20Smith
		user="John Smith"
		user="J. \"Bob\" Smith"

	Defining an Access List

	Every access list definition must begin with an aclname and acltype, 
	followed by either type-specific arguments or a quoted filename that
	they are read from.

	   acl aclname acltype argument ...
	   acl aclname acltype "file" ...

	When using "file", the file should contain one item per line.


	ACL Options

	Some acl types supports options which changes their default behaviour:

	-i,+i	By default, regular expressions are CASE-SENSITIVE. To make them
		case-insensitive, use the -i option. To return case-sensitive
		use the +i option between patterns, or make a new ACL line
		without -i.	

	-n	Disable lookups and address type conversions.  If lookup or
		conversion is required because the parameter type (IP or
		domain name) does not match the message address type (domain
		name or IP), then the ACL would immediately declare a mismatch
		without any warnings or lookups.

	-m[=delimiters]
		Perform a list membership test, interpreting values as
		comma-separated token lists and matching against individual
		tokens instead of whole values. 
		The optional "delimiters" parameter specifies one or more
		alternative non-alphanumeric delimiter characters.
		non-alphanumeric delimiter characters.

	--	Used to stop processing all options, in the case the first acl
		value has '-' character as first character (for example the '-'
		is a valid domain name)

	Some acl types require suspending the current request in order
	to access some external data source.
	Those which do are marked with the tag [slow], those which
	don't are marked as [fast].

	acl aclname note [-m[=delimiters]] name [value ...]
	  # match transaction annotation [fast]
	  # Without values, matches any annotation with a given name.
	  # With value(s), matches any annotation with a given name that
	  # also has one of the given values.
	  # If the -m flag is used, then the value of the named
	  # annotation is interpreted as a list of tokens, and the ACL
	  # matches individual name=token pairs rather than whole
	  # name=value pairs. See "ACL Options" above for more info.
	  # Annotation sources include note and adaptation_meta directives
	  # as well as helper and eCAP responses.

	acl aclname annotate_transaction [-m[=delimiters]] key=value ...
	acl aclname annotate_transaction [-m[=delimiters]] key+=value ...
	  # Always matches. [fast]
	  # Used for its side effect: This ACL immediately adds a
	  # key=value annotation to the current master transaction.
	  # The added annotation can then be tested using note ACL and
	  # logged (or sent to helpers) using %note format code.
	  #
	  # Annotations can be specified using replacement and addition
	  # formats. The key=value form replaces old same-key annotation
	  # value(s). The key+=value form appends a new value to the old
	  # same-key annotation. Both forms create a new key=value
	  # annotation if no same-key annotation exists already. If
	  # -m flag is used, then the value is interpreted as a list
	  # and the annotation will contain key=token pair(s) instead of the
	  # whole key=value pair.
	  #
	  # This ACL is especially useful for recording complex multi-step
	  # ACL-driven decisions. For example, the following configuration
	  # avoids logging transactions accepted after aclX matched:
	  #
	  #  # First, mark transactions accepted after aclX matched
	  #  acl markSpecial annotate_transaction special=true
	  #  http_access allow acl001
	  #  ...
	  #  http_access deny acl100
	  #  http_access allow aclX markSpecial
	  #
	  #  # Second, do not log marked transactions:
	  #  acl markedSpecial note special true
	  #  access_log ... deny markedSpecial
	  #
	  #  # Note that the following would not have worked because aclX
	  #  # alone does not determine whether the transaction was allowed:
	  #  access_log ... deny aclX # Wrong!
	  #
	  # Warning: This ACL annotates the transaction even when negated
	  # and even if subsequent ACLs fail to match. For example, the
	  # following three rules will have exactly the same effect as far
	  # as annotations set by the "mark" ACL are concerned:
	  #
	  #  some_directive acl1 ... mark # rule matches if mark is reached
	  #  some_directive acl1 ... !mark     # rule never matches
	  #  some_directive acl1 ... mark !all # rule never matches

	acl aclname annotate_client [-m[=delimiters]] key=value ...
	acl aclname annotate_client [-m[=delimiters]] key+=value ...
	  #
	  # Always matches. [fast]
	  # Used for its side effect: This ACL immediately adds a
	  # key=value annotation to the current client-to-Squid
	  # connection. Connection annotations are propagated to the current
	  # and all future master transactions on the annotated connection.
	  # See the annotate_transaction ACL for details.
	  #
	  # For example, the following configuration avoids rewriting URLs
	  # of transactions bumped by SslBump:
	  #
	  #  # First, mark bumped connections:
	  #  acl markBumped annotate_client bumped=true
	  #  ssl_bump peek acl1
	  #  ssl_bump stare acl2
	  #  ssl_bump bump acl3 markBumped
	  #  ssl_bump splice all
	  #
	  #  # Second, do not send marked transactions to the redirector:
	  #  acl markedBumped note bumped true
	  #  url_rewrite_access deny markedBumped
	  #
	  #  # Note that the following would not have worked because acl3 alone
	  #  # does not determine whether the connection is going to be bumped:
	  #  url_rewrite_access deny acl3 # Wrong!

	acl aclname adaptation_service service ...
	  # Matches the name of any icap_service, ecap_service,
	  # adaptation_service_set, or adaptation_service_chain that Squid
	  # has used (or attempted to use) for the master transaction.
	  # This ACL must be defined after the corresponding adaptation
	  # service is named in squid.conf. This ACL is usable with
	  # adaptation_meta because it starts matching immediately after
	  # the service has been selected for adaptation.

	acl aclname transaction_initiator initiator ...
	  # Matches transaction's initiator [fast]
	  #
	  # Supported initiators are:
	  #  esi: matches transactions fetching ESI resources
	  #  certificate-fetching: matches transactions fetching
	  #     a missing intermediate TLS certificate
	  #  cache-digest: matches transactions fetching Cache Digests
	  #     from a cache_peer
	  #  htcp: matches HTCP requests from peers
	  #  icp: matches ICP requests to peers
	  #  icmp: matches ICMP RTT database (NetDB) requests to peers
	  #  asn: matches asns db requests
	  #  internal: matches any of the above
	  #  client: matches transactions containing an HTTP or FTP
	  #     client request received at a Squid *_port
	  #  all: matches any transaction, including internal transactions
	  #     without a configurable initiator and hopefully rare
	  #     transactions without a known-to-Squid initiator
	  #
	  # Multiple initiators are ORed.

	acl aclname has component
	  # matches a transaction "component" [fast]
	  #
	  # Supported transaction components are:
	  #  request: transaction has a request header (at least)
	  #  response: transaction has a response header (at least)
	  #  ALE: transaction has an internally-generated Access Log Entry
	  #       structure; bugs notwithstanding, all transaction have it
	  #
	  # For example, the following configuration helps when dealing with HTTP
	  # clients that close connections without sending a request header:
	  #
	  #  acl hasRequest has request
	  #  acl logMe note important_transaction
	  #  # avoid "logMe ACL is used in context without an HTTP request" warnings
	  #  access_log ... logformat=detailed hasRequest logMe
	  #  # log request-less transactions, instead of ignoring them
	  #  access_log ... logformat=brief !hasRequest
	  #
	  # Multiple components are not supported for one "acl" rule, but
	  # can be specified (and are ORed) using multiple same-name rules:
	  #
	  #  # OK, this strange logging daemon needs request or response,
	  #  # but can work without either a request or a response:
	  #  acl hasWhatMyLoggingDaemonNeeds has request
	  #  acl hasWhatMyLoggingDaemonNeeds has response

	  # subject (CN and SubjectAltName). The computed server name(s) usually
	  # change with each SslBump step, as more info becomes available:
	  # * SNI is used as the server name instead of the request URI,
	  # * subject name(s) from the server certificate (CN and
	  #   SubjectAltName) are used as the server names instead of SNI.
	  #
	  # When the ACL computes multiple server names, matching any single
	  # computed name is sufficient for the ACL to match.
	  #
	  # The "none" name can be used to match transactions where the ACL
	  # could not compute the server name using any information source
	  # that was both available and allowed to be used by the ACL options at
	  # the ACL evaluation time.
	  #
	  # Unlike dstdomain, this ACL does not perform DNS lookups.
	  #
	  # An ACL option below may be used to restrict what information 
	  # sources are used to extract the server names from:
	  #
	  # --client-requested
	  #   The server name is SNI regardless of what the server says.
	  # --server-provided
	  #   The server name(s) are the certificate subject name(s), regardless
	  #   of what the client has requested. If the server certificate is
	  #   unavailable, then the name is "none".
	  # --consensus
	  #   The server name is either SNI (if SNI matches at least one of the
	  #   certificate subject names) or "none" (otherwise). When the server
	  #   certificate is unavailable, the consensus server name is SNI.
	  #
	  # Combining multiple options in one ACL is a fatal configuration

	before reaching us. The original source details may by sent in:
		* HTTP message Forwarded header, or
		* HTTP message X-Forwarded-For header, or
		* PROXY protocol connection header.

	This directive is solely for validating new PROXY protocol
	connections received from a port flagged with require-proxy-header.
	It is checked only once after TCP connection setup.

	A deny match results in TCP connection closure.

	An allow match is required for Squid to permit the corresponding
	TCP connection, before Squid even looks for HTTP request headers.
	If there is an allow match, Squid starts using PROXY header information
	to determine the source address of the connection for all future ACL
	checks, logging, etc.

	SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:

		Any host from which we accept client IP details can place
		incorrect information in the relevant header, and Squid
		will use the incorrect information as if it were the
		source address of the request.  This may enable remote
		hosts to bypass any access control restrictions that are

	before reaching us. The original source details may by sent in:
		* HTTP message Forwarded header, or
		* HTTP message X-Forwarded-For header, or
		* PROXY protocol connection header.

	PROXY protocol connections are controlled by the proxy_protocol_access
	directive which is checked before this.

	If a request reaches us from a source that is allowed by this
	directive, then we trust the information it provides regarding
	the IP of the client it received from (if any).

	For the purpose of ACLs used in this directive the src ACL type always
	matches the address we are testing and srcdomain matches its rDNS.

	On each HTTP request Squid checks for X-Forwarded-For header fields.
	If found the header values are iterated in reverse order and an allow
	match is required for Squid to continue on to the next value.
	The verification ends when a value receives a deny match, cannot be
	tested, or there are no more values to test.
	NOTE: Squid does not yet follow the Forwarded HTTP header.

	The end result of this process is an IP address that we will
	refer to as the indirect client address.  This address may
	be treated as the client address for access control, ICAP, delay
	pools and logging, depending on the acl_uses_indirect_client,
	icap_uses_indirect_client, delay_pool_uses_indirect_client, 
	log_uses_indirect_client and tproxy_uses_indirect_client options.

	This option specifies the maximum size of a reply body. It can be
	used to prevent users from downloading very large files, such as
	MP3's and movies. When the reply headers are received, the
	reply_body_max_size lines are processed, and the first line where
	all (if any) listed ACLs are true is used as the maximum body size
	for this reply.

	This size is checked twice. First when we get the reply headers,
	we check the content-length value.  If the content length value exists
	and is larger than the allowed size, the request is denied and the
	user receives an error message that says "the request or reply
	is too large." If there is no content-length, and the reply
	size exceeds this limit, the client's connection is just closed
	and they will receive a partial reply.

	WARNING: downstream caches probably can not detect a partial reply
	if there is no content-length header, so they will cache
	partial responses and give them out as hits.  You should NOT
	use this option if you have downstream caches.

	WARNING: A maximum size smaller than the size of squid's error messages
	will cause an infinite loop and crash squid. Ensure that the smallest
	non-zero value you use is greater that the maximum header size plus
	the size of your largest error page.

	If you set this parameter none (the default), there will be
	no limit imposed.

DEFAULT_DOC: Respond with an error message to unidentifiable traffic
DOC_START
	Determines Squid behavior when encountering strange requests at the
	beginning of an accepted TCP connection or the beginning of a bumped
	CONNECT tunnel. Controlling Squid reaction to unexpected traffic is
	especially useful in interception environments where Squid is likely
	to see connections for unsupported protocols that Squid should either
	terminate or tunnel at TCP level.
 
		on_unsupported_protocol <action> [!]acl ...
 
	The first matching action wins. Only fast ACLs are supported.

	Supported actions are:
 
	tunnel: Establish a TCP connection with the intended server and
		blindly shovel TCP packets between the client and server.

	respond: Respond with an error message, using the transfer protocol
		for the Squid port that received the request (e.g., HTTP
		for connections intercepted at the http_port). This is the
		default.

	Squid expects the following traffic patterns:

	  http_port: a plain HTTP request
	  https_port: SSL/TLS handshake followed by an [encrypted] HTTP request
	  ftp_port: a plain FTP command (no on_unsupported_protocol support yet!)
	  CONNECT tunnel on http_port: same as https_port
	  CONNECT tunnel on https_port: same as https_port

	Currently, this directive has effect on intercepted connections and
	bumped tunnels only. Other cases are not supported because Squid
	cannot know the intended destination of other traffic.

	For example:
	  # define what Squid errors indicate receiving non-HTTP traffic:
	  acl foreignProtocol squid_error ERR_PROTOCOL_UNKNOWN ERR_TOO_BIG
	  # define what Squid errors indicate receiving nothing:
	  acl serverTalksFirstProtocol squid_error ERR_REQUEST_START_TIMEOUT
	  # tunnel everything that does not look like HTTP:
          on_unsupported_protocol tunnel foreignProtocol
	  # tunnel if we think the client waits for the server to talk first:

		auth_schemes scheme1,scheme2,... [!]aclname ...

	where schemeN is the name of one of the authentication schemes
	configured using auth_param directives. At least one scheme name is
	required. Multiple scheme names are separated by commas. Either
	avoid whitespace or quote the entire schemes list.

	A special "ALL" scheme name expands to all auth_param-configured
	schemes in their configuration order. This directive cannot be used
	to configure Squid to offer no authentication schemes at all.

	The first matching auth_schemes rule determines the schemes order
	for the current Authentication Required transaction. Note that the
	future response is not yet available during auth_schemes evaluation.

	If this directive is not used or none of its rules match, then Squid
	responds with all configured authentication schemes in the order of
	auth_param directives in the configuration file.

	This directive does not determine when authentication is used or
	how each authentication scheme authenticates clients.

	The following example sends basic and negotiate authentication
	schemes, in that order, when requesting authentication of HTTP
	requests matching the isIE ACL (not shown) while sending all
	auth_param schemes in their configuration order to other clients:

		auth_schemes basic,negotiate isIE
		auth_schemes ALL all # explicit default

	There are three forms: port alone, hostname with port, and

			bumping of CONNECT requests.

	Omitting the mode flag causes default forward proxy mode to be used.


	Accelerator Mode Options:

	   defaultsite=domainname
			What to use for the Host: header if it is not present
			in a request. Determines what site (not origin server)
			accelerators should consider the default.

	   no-vhost	Disable using HTTP/1.1 Host header for virtual domain support.

	   protocol=	Protocol to reconstruct accelerated and intercepted
			requests with. Defaults to HTTP/1.1 for http_port and
			HTTPS/1.1 for https_port.
			When an unsupported value is configured Squid will
			produce a FATAL error.
			Values: HTTP or HTTP/1.1, HTTPS or HTTPS/1.1

	   vport	Virtual host port support. Using the http_port number
			instead of the port passed on Host: headers.

	   vport=NN	Virtual host port support. Using the specified port
			number instead of the port passed on Host: headers.

	   act-as-origin
			Act as if this Squid is the origin server.
			This currently means generate new Date: and Expires:
			headers on HIT instead of adding Age:.

	   ignore-cc	Ignore request Cache-Control headers.

			WARNING: This option violates HTTP specifications if
			used in non-accelerator setups.

	   allow-direct	Allow direct forwarding in accelerator mode. Normally
			accelerated requests are denied direct forwarding as if
			never_direct was used.

			WARNING: this option opens accelerator mode to security
			vulnerabilities usually only affecting in interception
			mode. Make sure to protect forwarding with suitable
			http_access rules when using this.


	SSL Bump Mode Options:
	    In addition to these options ssl-bump requires TLS/SSL options.

	   generate-host-certificates[=<on|off>]
			Dynamically create SSL server certificates for the
			destination hosts of bumped CONNECT requests.When 
			enabled, the cert and key options are used to sign
			generated certificates. Otherwise generated
			certificate will be selfsigned.
			If there is a CA certificate lifetime of the generated 
			certificate equals lifetime of the CA certificate. If
			generated certificate is selfsigned lifetime is three 
			years.
			This option is enabled by default when ssl-bump is used.
			See the ssl-bump option above for more information.
			
	   dynamic_cert_mem_cache_size=SIZE
			Approximate total RAM size spent on cached generated
			certificates. If set to zero, caching is disabled. The
			default value is 4MB.

	TLS / SSL Options:

	   tls-cert=	Path to file containing an X.509 certificate (PEM format)
			to be used in the TLS handshake ServerHello.

			If this certificate is constrained by KeyUsage TLS
			feature it must allow HTTP server usage, along with
			any additional restrictions imposed by your choice
			of options= settings.

			When OpenSSL is used this file may also contain a
			chain of intermediate CA certificates to send in the
			TLS handshake.

			When GnuTLS is used this option (and any paired
			tls-key= option) may be repeated to load multiple
			certificates for different domains.

			Also, when generate-host-certificates=on is configured
			the first tls-cert= option must be a CA certificate
			capable of signing the automatically generated
			certificates.

	   tls-key=	Path to a file containing private key file (PEM format)
			for the previous tls-cert= option.

			If tls-key= is not specified tls-cert= is assumed to
			reference a PEM file containing both the certificate
			and private key.

	   cipher=	Colon separated list of supported ciphers.
			NOTE: some ciphers such as EDH ciphers depend on
			      additional settings. If those settings are
			      omitted the ciphers may be silently ignored
			      by the OpenSSL library.

	   options=	Various SSL implementation options. The most important
			being:

			    NO_SSLv3    Disallow the use of SSLv3

			    NO_TLSv1    Disallow the use of TLSv1.0

			    NO_TLSv1_1  Disallow the use of TLSv1.1

			    NO_TLSv1_2  Disallow the use of TLSv1.2

			    SINGLE_DH_USE
				      Always create a new key when using
				      temporary/ephemeral DH key exchanges

			    SINGLE_ECDH_USE
				      Enable ephemeral ECDH key exchange.
				      The adopted curve should be specified
				      using the tls-dh option.

			    NO_TICKET
				      Disable use of RFC5077 session tickets.
				      Some servers may have problems
				      understanding the TLS extension due
				      to ambiguous specification in RFC4507.

			    ALL       Enable various bug workarounds
				      suggested as "harmless" by OpenSSL
				      Be warned that this reduces SSL/TLS
				      strength to some attacks.

			See the OpenSSL SSL_CTX_set_options documentation for a
			more complete list.

	   clientca=	File containing the list of CAs to use when
			requesting a client certificate.

	   tls-cafile=	PEM file containing CA certificates to use when verifying
			client certificates. If not configured clientca will be
			used. May be repeated to load multiple files.

	   capath=	Directory containing additional CA certificates
			and CRL lists to use when verifying client certificates.
			Requires OpenSSL or LibreSSL.

	   crlfile=	File of additional CRL lists to use when verifying
			the client certificate, in addition to CRLs stored in
			the capath. Implies VERIFY_CRL flag below.

	   tls-dh=[curve:]file
			File containing DH parameters for temporary/ephemeral DH key
			exchanges, optionally prefixed by a curve for ephemeral ECDH
			key exchanges.
			See OpenSSL documentation for details on how to create the
			DH parameter file. Supported curves for ECDH can be listed
			using the "openssl ecparam -list_curves" command.
			WARNING: EDH and EECDH ciphers will be silently disabled if
				 this option is not set.

	   sslflags=	Various flags modifying the use of SSL:
			    DELAYED_AUTH
				Don't request client certificates
				immediately, but wait until acl processing
				requires a certificate (not yet implemented).
			    NO_SESSION_REUSE
				Don't allow for session reuse. Each connection
				will result in a new SSL session.
			    VERIFY_CRL
				Verify CRL lists when accepting client
				certificates.
			    VERIFY_CRL_ALL
				Verify CRL lists for all certificates in the
				client certificate chain.

	   tls-default-ca[=off]
			Whether to use the system Trusted CAs. Default is OFF.

	   tls-no-npn	Do not use the TLS NPN extension to advertise HTTP/1.1.

	   sslcontext=	SSL session ID context identifier.

	Other Options:

	   connection-auth[=on|off]
	                use connection-auth=off to tell Squid to prevent 
	                forwarding Microsoft connection oriented authentication
			(NTLM, Negotiate and Kerberos)

	   disable-pmtu-discovery=
			Control Path-MTU discovery usage:
			    off		lets OS decide on what to do (default).
			    transparent	disable PMTU discovery when transparent
					support is enabled.
			    always	disable always PMTU discovery.

			In many setups of transparently intercepting proxies
			Path-MTU discovery can not work on traffic towards the
			clients. This is the case when the intercepting device
			does not fully track connections and fails to forward
			ICMP must fragment messages to the cache server. If you
			have such setup and experience that certain clients
			sporadically hang or never complete requests set
			disable-pmtu-discovery option to 'transparent'.

	   name=	Specifies a internal name for the port. Defaults to
			the port specification (port or addr:port)

	   tcpkeepalive[=idle,interval,timeout]
			Enable TCP keepalive probes of idle connections.
			In seconds; idle is the initial time before TCP starts
			probing the connection, interval how often to probe, and
			timeout the time before giving up.

	   require-proxy-header
			Require PROXY protocol version 1 or 2 connections.
			The proxy_protocol_access is required to whitelist
			downstream proxies which can be trusted.

	   worker-queues
			Ask TCP stack to maintain a dedicated listening queue
			for each worker accepting requests at this port.
			Requires TCP stack that supports the SO_REUSEPORT socket
			option.

			SECURITY WARNING: Enabling worker-specific queues
			allows any process running as Squid's effective user to
			easily accept requests destined to this port.

	If you run Squid on a dual-homed machine with an internal
	and an external interface we recommend you to specify the
	internal address:port in http_port. This way Squid will only be
	visible on the internal address.

DOC_START
	Enables Native FTP proxy by specifying the socket address where Squid
	listens for FTP client requests. See http_port directive for various
	ways to specify the listening address and mode.

	Usage: ftp_port address [mode] [options]

	WARNING: This is a new, experimental, complex feature that has seen
	limited production exposure. Some Squid modules (e.g., caching) do not
	currently work with native FTP proxying, and many features have not
	even been tested for compatibility. Test well before deploying!

	Native FTP proxying differs substantially from proxying HTTP requests
	with ftp:// URIs because Squid works as an FTP server and receives
	actual FTP commands (rather than HTTP requests with FTP URLs).

	Native FTP commands accepted at ftp_port are internally converted or
	wrapped into HTTP-like messages. The same happens to Native FTP
	responses received from FTP origin servers. Those HTTP-like messages
	are shoveled through regular access control and adaptation layers
	between the FTP client and the FTP origin server. This allows Squid to
	examine, adapt, block, and log FTP exchanges. Squid reuses most HTTP
	mechanisms when shoveling wrapped FTP messages. For example,
	http_access and adaptation_access directives are used.

	Modes:

	   intercept	Same as http_port intercept. The FTP origin address is
			determined based on the intended destination of the
			intercepted connection.

	   tproxy	Support Linux TPROXY for spoofing outgoing
			connections using the client IP address.
			NP: disables authentication and maybe IPv6 on the port.

	By default (i.e., without an explicit mode option), Squid extracts the
	FTP origin address from the login@origin parameter of the FTP USER
	command. Many popular FTP clients support such native FTP proxying.

	Options:

	   name=token	Specifies an internal name for the port. Defaults to
			the port address. Usable with myportname ACL.

	   ftp-track-dirs
			Enables tracking of FTP directories by injecting extra
			PWD commands and adjusting Request-URI (in wrapping
			HTTP requests) to reflect the current FTP server
			directory. Tracking is disabled by default.

	   protocol=FTP	Protocol to reconstruct accelerated and intercepted
			requests with. Defaults to FTP. No other accepted
			values have been tested with. An unsupported value
			results in a FATAL error. Accepted values are FTP,
			HTTP (or HTTP/1.1), and HTTPS (or HTTPS/1.1).

	Other http_port modes and options that are not specific to HTTP and

	The mark-value and mask are unsigned integers (hex, octal, or decimal).
	The mask may be used to preserve marking previously set by other agents
	(e.g., iptables).

	A matching rule replaces the CONNMARK value. If a mask is also
	specified, then the masked bits of the original value are zeroed, and
	the configured mark-value is ORed with that adjusted value.
	For example, applying a mark-value 0xAB/0xF to 0x5F CONNMARK, results
	in a 0xFB marking (rather than a 0xAB or 0x5B).

	This directive semantics is similar to iptables --set-mark rather than
	--set-xmark functionality.

	The directive does not interfere with qos_flows (which uses packet MARKs,
	not CONNMARKs).

	For platforms using netfilter, allows you to set a netfilter mark
	value instead of, or in addition to, a TOS value.

	By default this functionality is disabled. To enable it with the default
	settings simply use "qos_flows mark" or "qos_flows tos". Default
	settings will result in the netfilter mark or TOS value being copied
	from the upstream connection to the client. Note that it is the connection
	CONNMARK value not the packet MARK value that is copied.

	It is not currently possible to copy the mark or TOS value from the
	client to the upstream connection request.

	TOS values really only have local significance - so you should
	know what you're specifying. For more information, see RFC2474,
	RFC2475, and RFC3260.

	The TOS/DSCP byte must be exactly that - a octet value  0 - 255.

	The squid parser will enforce this by masking away the ECN bits.

	Mark values can be any unsigned 32-bit integer value.

	This setting is configured by setting the following values:

	tos|mark                Whether to set TOS or netfilter mark values

	local-hit=0xFF		Value to mark local cache hits.

	sibling-hit=0xFF	Value to mark hits from sibling peers.

	parent-hit=0xFF		Value to mark hits from parent peers.

	miss=0xFF[/mask]	Value to mark cache misses. Takes precedence
				over the preserve-miss feature (see below), unless
				mask is specified, in which case only the bits
				specified in the mask are written.

	The TOS variant of the following features are only possible on Linux
	and require your kernel to be patched with the TOS preserving ZPH
	patch, available from http://zph.bratcheda.org
	No patch is needed to preserve the netfilter mark, which will work
	with all variants of netfilter.

	disable-preserve-miss
		This option disables the preservation of the TOS or netfilter
		mark. By default, the existing TOS or netfilter mark value of
		the response coming from the remote server will be retained
		and masked with miss-mark.
		NOTE: in the case of a netfilter mark, the mark must be set on
		the connection (using the CONNMARK target) not on the packet
		(MARK target).

	miss-mask=0xFF
		Allows you to mask certain bits in the TOS or mark value
		received from the remote server, before copying the value to
		the TOS sent towards clients.
		Default for tos: 0xFF (TOS from server is not changed).
		Default for mark: 0xFFFFFFFF (mark from server is not changed).

	All of these features require the --enable-zph-qos compilation flag
	(enabled by default). Netfilter marking also requires the
	libnetfilter_conntrack libraries (--with-netfilter-conntrack) and
	libcap 2.09+ (--with-libcap).

LOC: Config.onoff.hostStrictVerify
DOC_START
	Regardless of this option setting, when dealing with intercepted

	the Host header domain or IP (called 'authority form URL').
	
	This enforcement is performed to satisfy a MUST-level requirement in
	RFC 2616 section 14.23: "The Host field value MUST represent the naming
	authority of the origin server or gateway given by the original URL".
	
	When set to ON:
		Squid always responds with an HTTP 409 (Conflict) error
		page and logs a security warning if there is no match.
	
		Squid verifies that the destination IP address matches
		the Host header for forward-proxy and reverse-proxy traffic
		as well. For those traffic types, Squid also enables the
		following checks, comparing the corresponding Host header
		and Request-URI components:
	
		 * The host names (domain or IP) must be identical,
		   but valueless or missing Host header disables all checks.
		   For the two host names to match, both must be either IP
		   or FQDN.
	
		 * Port numbers must be identical, but if a port is missing
		   the scheme-default port is assumed.
	
	
	When set to OFF (the default):
		Squid allows suspicious requests to continue but logs a
		security warning and blocks caching of the response.
	
		 * Forward-proxy traffic is not checked at all.
	
		 * Reverse-proxy traffic is not checked at all.
	
		 * Intercepted traffic which passes verification is handled
		   according to client_dst_passthru.
	
		 * Intercepted requests which fail verification are sent
		   to the client original destination instead of DIRECT.
		   This overrides 'client_dst_passthru off'.
	
		For now suspicious intercepted CONNECT requests are always
		responded to with an HTTP 409 (Conflict) error page.
	
	
	SECURITY NOTE:
	
	As described in CVE-2009-0801 when the Host: header alone is used
	to determine the destination of a request it becomes trivial for
	malicious scripts on remote websites to bypass browser same-origin
	security policy and sandboxing protections.
	
	The cause of this is that such applets are allowed to perform their
	own HTTP stack, in which case the same-origin policy of the browser
	sandbox only verifies that the applet tries to contact the same IP
	as from where it was loaded at the IP level. The Host: header may
	be different from the connected IP and approved origin.

	Many origin servers fail to send their full server certificate
	chain for verification, assuming the client already has or can
	easily locate any missing intermediate certificates.

	Squid uses the certificates from the specified file to fill in
	these missing chains when trying to validate origin server
	certificate chains.

	The file is expected to contain zero or more PEM-encoded
	intermediate certificates. These certificates are not treated
	as trusted root certificates, and any self-signed certificate in

	Sets the hashing algorithm to use when signing generated certificates.
	Valid algorithm names depend on the OpenSSL library used. The following
	names are usually available: sha1, sha256, sha512, and md5. Please see
	your OpenSSL library manual for the available hashes. By default, Squids
	that support this option use sha256 hashes.

	Squid does not forcefully purge cached certificates that were generated

DEFAULT: none
DOC_START
	This option is consulted when a CONNECT request is received on
	an http_port (or a new connection is intercepted at an
	https_port), provided that port was configured with an ssl-bump
	flag. The subsequent data on the connection is either treated as
	HTTPS and decrypted OR tunneled at TCP level without decryption,
	depending on the first matching bumping "action".

	ssl_bump <action> [!]acl ...

	The following bumping actions are currently supported:

	    splice
		Become a TCP tunnel without decrypting proxied traffic.
		This is the default action.

	    bump
		When used on step SslBump1, establishes a secure connection
		with the client first, then connect to the server.
		When used on step SslBump2 or SslBump3, establishes a secure
		connection with the server and, using a mimicked server
		certificate, with the client.

	    peek
		Receive client (step SslBump1) or server (step SslBump2)
		certificate while preserving the possibility of splicing the
		connection. Peeking at the server certificate (during step 2)
		usually precludes bumping of the connection at step 3.

	    stare
		Receive client (step SslBump1) or server (step SslBump2)
		certificate while preserving the possibility of bumping the
		connection. Staring at the server certificate (during step 2)
		usually precludes splicing of the connection at step 3.

	    terminate
		Close client and server connections.

	Backward compatibility actions available at step SslBump1:

	    client-first
		Bump the connection. Establish a secure connection with the
		client first, then connect to the server. This old mode does
		not allow Squid to mimic server SSL certificate and does not
		work with intercepted SSL connections.

	    server-first
		Bump the connection. Establish a secure connection with the
		server first, then establish a secure connection with the
		client, using a mimicked server certificate. Works with both
		CONNECT requests and intercepted SSL connections, but does
		not allow to make decisions based on SSL handshake info.

	    peek-and-splice
		Decide whether to bump or splice the connection based on 
		client-to-squid and server-to-squid SSL hello messages.
		XXX: Remove.

	    none
		Same as the "splice" action.

	All ssl_bump rules are evaluated at each of the supported bumping
	steps.  Rules with actions that are impossible at the current step are
	ignored. The first matching ssl_bump action wins and is applied at the
	end of the current step. If no rules match, the splice action is used.
	See the at_step ACL for a list of the supported SslBump steps.

	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.
	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.

        sslproxy_cert_sign <signing algorithm> acl ...

        The following certificate signing algorithms are supported:

	   signTrusted
		Sign using the configured CA certificate which is usually
		placed in and trusted by end-user browsers. This is the
		default for trusted origin server certificates.

	   signUntrusted
		Sign to guarantee an X509_V_ERR_CERT_UNTRUSTED browser error.
		This is the default for untrusted origin server certificates
		that are not self-signed (see ssl::certUntrusted).

	   signSelf
		Sign using a self-signed certificate with the right CN to
		generate a X509_V_ERR_DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT error in the
		browser. This is the default for self-signed origin server
		certificates (see ssl::certSelfSigned).

	This clause only supports fast acl types.

	When sslproxy_cert_sign acl(s) match, Squid uses the corresponding
	signing algorithm to generate the certificate and ignores all
	subsequent sslproxy_cert_sign options (the first match wins). If no
	acl(s) match, the default signing algorithm is determined by errors
	detected when obtaining and validating the origin server certificate.

	WARNING: SQUID_X509_V_ERR_DOMAIN_MISMATCH and ssl:certDomainMismatch can
	be used with sslproxy_cert_adapt, but if and only if Squid is bumping a
	CONNECT request that carries a domain name. In all other cases (CONNECT
	to an IP address or an intercepted SSL connection), Squid cannot detect
	the domain mismatch at certificate generation time when
	bump-server-first is used.

		the CA certificate used to sign generated certificates.

	   setValidBefore
		Sets the "Not Before" property to the "Not Before" property of
		the CA certificate used to sign generated certificates.

	   setCommonName or setCommonName{CN}
		Sets Subject.CN property to the host name specified as a 
		CN parameter or, if no explicit CN parameter was specified,
		extracted from the CONNECT request. It is a misconfiguration
		to use setCommonName without an explicit parameter for
		intercepted or tproxied SSL connections.
		
	This clause only supports fast acl types.

	Squid first groups sslproxy_cert_adapt options by adaptation algorithm.
	Within a group, when sslproxy_cert_adapt acl(s) match, Squid uses the
	corresponding adaptation algorithm to generate the certificate and
	ignores all subsequent sslproxy_cert_adapt options in that algorithm's
	group (i.e., the first match wins within each algorithm group). If no
	acl(s) match, the default mimicking action takes place.

	WARNING: SQUID_X509_V_ERR_DOMAIN_MISMATCH and ssl:certDomainMismatch can
	be used with sslproxy_cert_adapt, but if and only if Squid is bumping a
	CONNECT request that carries a domain name. In all other cases (CONNECT

	cache_peer cdn.example.com      sibling   3128     0  
	
	      type:	either 'parent', 'sibling', or 'multicast'.
	
	proxy-port:	The port number where the peer accept HTTP requests.
			For other Squid proxies this is usually 3128
			For web servers this is usually 80
	
	  icp-port:	Used for querying neighbor caches about objects.
			Set to 0 if the peer does not support ICP or HTCP.
			See ICP and HTCP options below for additional details.
	
	
	==== ICP OPTIONS ====
	
	You MUST also set icp_port and icp_access explicitly when using these options.
	The defaults will prevent peer traffic using ICP.
	
	
	no-query	Disable ICP queries to this neighbor.
	
	multicast-responder
			Indicates the named peer is a member of a multicast group.
			ICP queries will not be sent directly to the peer, but ICP
			replies will be accepted from it.
	
	closest-only	Indicates that, for ICP_OP_MISS replies, we'll only forward
			CLOSEST_PARENT_MISSes and never FIRST_PARENT_MISSes.
	
	background-ping
			To only send ICP queries to this neighbor infrequently.
			This is used to keep the neighbor round trip time updated
			and is usually used in conjunction with weighted-round-robin.
	
	
	==== HTCP OPTIONS ====
	
	You MUST also set htcp_port and htcp_access explicitly when using these options.
	The defaults will prevent peer traffic using HTCP.
	
	
	htcp		Send HTCP, instead of ICP, queries to the neighbor.
			You probably also want to set the "icp-port" to 4827
			instead of 3130. This directive accepts a comma separated
			list of options described below.
	
	htcp=oldsquid	Send HTCP to old Squid versions (2.5 or earlier).
	
	htcp=no-clr	Send HTCP to the neighbor but without
			sending any CLR requests.  This cannot be used with
			only-clr.
	
	htcp=only-clr	Send HTCP to the neighbor but ONLY CLR requests.
			This cannot be used with no-clr.
	
	htcp=no-purge-clr
			Send HTCP to the neighbor including CLRs but only when
			they do not result from PURGE requests.
	
	htcp=forward-clr
			Forward any HTCP CLR requests this proxy receives to the peer.
	
	
	==== PEER SELECTION METHODS ====
	
	The default peer selection method is ICP, with the first responding peer
	being used as source. These options can be used for better load balancing.
	
	
	default		This is a parent cache which can be used as a "last-resort"
			if a peer cannot be located by any of the peer-selection methods.
			If specified more than once, only the first is used.
	
	round-robin	Load-Balance parents which should be used in a round-robin
			fashion in the absence of any ICP queries.
			weight=N can be used to add bias.
	
	weighted-round-robin
			Load-Balance parents which should be used in a round-robin
			fashion with the frequency of each parent being based on the
			round trip time. Closer parents are used more often.
			Usually used for background-ping parents.
			weight=N can be used to add bias.
	
	carp		Load-Balance parents which should be used as a CARP array.
			The requests will be distributed among the parents based on the
			CARP load balancing hash function based on their weight.
	
	userhash	Load-balance parents based on the client proxy_auth or ident username.
	
	sourcehash	Load-balance parents based on the client source IP.

	multicast-siblings
			To be used only for cache peers of type "multicast".
			ALL members of this multicast group have "sibling"
			relationship with it, not "parent".  This is to a multicast
			group when the requested object would be fetched only from
			a "parent" cache, anyway.  It's useful, e.g., when
			configuring a pool of redundant Squid proxies, being
			members of the same multicast group.
	
	
	==== PEER SELECTION OPTIONS ====
	
	weight=N	use to affect the selection of a peer during any weighted
			peer-selection mechanisms.
			The weight must be an integer; default is 1,
			larger weights are favored more.
			This option does not affect parent selection if a peering
			protocol is not in use.
	
	basetime=N	Specify a base amount to be subtracted from round trip
			times of parents.
			It is subtracted before division by weight in calculating
			which parent to fectch from. If the rtt is less than the
			base time the rtt is set to a minimal value.
	
	ttl=N		Specify a TTL to use when sending multicast ICP queries
			to this address.
			Only useful when sending to a multicast group.
			Because we don't accept ICP replies from random
			hosts, you must configure other group members as
			peers with the 'multicast-responder' option.
	
	no-delay	To prevent access to this neighbor from influencing the
			delay pools.
	
	digest-url=URL	Tell Squid to fetch the cache digest (if digests are
			enabled) for this host from the specified URL rather
			than the Squid default location.
	
	
	==== CARP OPTIONS ====
	
	carp-key=key-specification
			use a different key than the full URL to hash against the peer.
			the key-specification is a comma-separated list of the keywords			
			scheme, host, port, path, params
			Order is not important.
	
	==== ACCELERATOR / REVERSE-PROXY OPTIONS ====
	
	originserver	Causes this parent to be contacted as an origin server.
			Meant to be used in accelerator setups when the peer
			is a web server.
	
	forceddomain=name
			Set the Host header of requests forwarded to this peer.
			Useful in accelerator setups where the server (peer)
			expects a certain domain name but clients may request
			others. ie example.com or www.example.com
	
	no-digest	Disable request of cache digests.
	
	no-netdb-exchange
			Disables requesting ICMP RTT database (NetDB).
	
	
	==== AUTHENTICATION OPTIONS ====
	
	login=user:password
			If this is a personal/workgroup proxy and your parent
			requires proxy authentication.
			
			Note: The string can include URL escapes (i.e. %20 for
			spaces). This also means % must be written as %%.
	
	login=PASSTHRU
			Send login details received from client to this peer.
			Both Proxy- and WWW-Authorization headers are passed
			without alteration to the peer.
			Authentication is not required by Squid for this to work.
			
			Note: This will pass any form of authentication but
			only Basic auth will work through a proxy unless the
			connection-auth options are also used.

	login=PASS	Send login details received from client to this peer.
			Authentication is not required by this option.
			
			If there are no client-provided authentication headers
			to pass on, but username and password are available
			from an external ACL user= and password= result tags
			they may be sent instead.
			
			Note: To combine this with proxy_auth both proxies must
			share the same user database as HTTP only allows for
			a single login (one for proxy, one for origin server).
			Also be warned this will expose your users proxy
			password to the peer. USE WITH CAUTION
	
	login=*:password
			Send the username to the upstream cache, but with a
			fixed password. This is meant to be used when the peer
			is in another administrative domain, but it is still
			needed to identify each user.
			The star can optionally be followed by some extra
			information which is added to the username. This can
			be used to identify this proxy to the peer, similar to
			the login=username:password option above.
	
	login=NEGOTIATE
			If this is a personal/workgroup proxy and your parent
			requires a secure proxy authentication.
			The first principal from the default keytab or defined by
			the environment variable KRB5_KTNAME will be used. 
	
			WARNING: The connection may transmit requests from multiple
			clients. Negotiate often assumes end-to-end authentication
			and a single-client. Which is not strictly true here.
	
	login=NEGOTIATE:principal_name
			If this is a personal/workgroup proxy and your parent
			requires a secure proxy authentication. 
			The principal principal_name from the default keytab or
			defined by the environment variable KRB5_KTNAME will be
			used.
	
			WARNING: The connection may transmit requests from multiple
			clients. Negotiate often assumes end-to-end authentication
			and a single-client. Which is not strictly true here.
	
	connection-auth=on|off
			Tell Squid that this peer does or not support Microsoft
			connection oriented authentication, and any such
			challenges received from there should be ignored.
			Default is auto to automatically determine the status
			of the peer.
	
	auth-no-keytab
			Do not use a keytab to authenticate to a peer when
			login=NEGOTIATE is specified. Let the GSSAPI
			implementation determine which already existing
			credentials cache to use instead.

	sslcapath=...	A directory containing additional CA certificates to
			use when verifying the peer certificate.
			Requires OpenSSL or LibreSSL.
	
	sslcrlfile=... 	A certificate revocation list file to use when

				verify.

			DONT_VERIFY_DOMAIN
				Don't verify the peer certificate
				matches the server name
	
	ssldomain= 	The peer name as advertised in it's certificate.
			Used for verifying the correctness of the received peer
			certificate. If not specified the peer hostname will be
			used.
	
	front-end-https[=off|on|auto]
			Enable the "Front-End-Https: On" header needed when
			using Squid as a SSL frontend in front of Microsoft OWA.
			See MS KB document Q307347 for details on this header.
			If set to auto the header will only be added if the
			request is forwarded as a https:// URL.
	
	tls-default-ca[=off]
			Whether to use the system Trusted CAs. Default is ON.
	
	tls-no-npn	Do not use the TLS NPN extension to advertise HTTP/1.1.

	==== GENERAL OPTIONS ====
	
	connect-timeout=N
			A peer-specific connect timeout.
			Also see the peer_connect_timeout directive.
	
	connect-fail-limit=N
			How many times connecting to a peer must fail before
			it is marked as down. Standby connection failures
			count towards this limit. Default is 10.
	
	allow-miss	Disable Squid's use of only-if-cached when forwarding
			requests to siblings. This is primarily useful when
			icp_hit_stale is used by the sibling. Excessive use
			of this option may result in forwarding loops. One way
			to prevent peering loops when using this option, is to
			deny cache peer usage on requests from a peer:
			acl fromPeer ...
			cache_peer_access peerName deny fromPeer
	
	max-conn=N 	Limit the number of concurrent connections the Squid
			may open to this peer, including already opened idle
			and standby connections. There is no peer-specific
			connection limit by default.
	
			A peer exceeding the limit is not used for new
			requests unless a standby connection is available.
	
			max-conn currently works poorly with idle persistent
			connections: When a peer reaches its max-conn limit,
			and there are idle persistent connections to the peer,
			the peer may not be selected because the limiting code
			does not know whether Squid can reuse those idle
			connections.
	
	standby=N	Maintain a pool of N "hot standby" connections to an
			UP peer, available for requests when no idle
			persistent connection is available (or safe) to use.
			By default and with zero N, no such pool is maintained.
			N must not exceed the max-conn limit (if any).
	
			At start or after reconfiguration, Squid opens new TCP
			standby connections until there are N connections
			available and then replenishes the standby pool as
			opened connections are used up for requests. A used
			connection never goes back to the standby pool, but
			may go to the regular idle persistent connection pool
			shared by all peers and origin servers.
	
			Squid never opens multiple new standby connections
			concurrently.  This one-at-a-time approach minimizes
			flooding-like effect on peers. Furthermore, just a few
			standby connections should be sufficient in most cases
			to supply most new requests with a ready-to-use
			connection.
	
			Standby connections obey server_idle_pconn_timeout.
			For the feature to work as intended, the peer must be
			configured to accept and keep them open longer than
			the idle timeout at the connecting Squid, to minimize
			race conditions typical to idle used persistent
			connections. Default request_timeout and
			server_idle_pconn_timeout values ensure such a
			configuration.
	
	name=xxx	Unique name for the peer.
			Required if you have multiple peers on the same host
			but different ports.
			This name can be used in cache_peer_access and similar
			directives to identify the peer.
			Can be used by outgoing access controls through the
			peername ACL type.
	
	no-tproxy	Do not use the client-spoof TPROXY support when forwarding
			requests to this peer. Use normal address selection instead.
			This overrides the spoof_client_ip ACL.
	
	proxy-only	objects fetched from the peer will not be stored locally.

NAME: cache_peer_access
TYPE: peer_access
DEFAULT: none
DEFAULT_DOC: No peer usage restrictions.
LOC: none
DOC_START
	Restricts usage of cache_peer proxies.

	Usage:
		cache_peer_access peer-name allow|deny [!]aclname ...

	For the required peer-name parameter, use either the value of the
	cache_peer name=value parameter or, if name=value is missing, the
	cache_peer hostname parameter.

	This directive narrows down the selection of peering candidates, but
	does not determine the order in which the selected candidates are
	contacted. That order is determined by the peer selection algorithms
	(see PEER SELECTION sections in the cache_peer documentation).

	If a deny rule matches, the corresponding peer will not be contacted
	for the current transaction -- Squid will not send ICP queries and
	will not forward HTTP requests to that peer. An allow match leaves
	the corresponding peer in the selection. The first match for a given
	peer wins for that peer.

	The relative order of cache_peer_access directives for the same peer
	matters. The relative order of any two cache_peer_access directives
	for different peers does not matter. To ease interpretation, it is a
	good idea to group cache_peer_access directives for the same peer
	together.

	A single cache_peer_access directive may be evaluated multiple times
	for a given transaction because individual peer selection algorithms
	may check it independently from each other. These redundant checks
	may be optimized away in future Squid versions.

	This clause only supports fast acl types.

	This controls how long Squid waits to declare a peer cache

	amount of time, Squid will declare the peer dead and not
	expect to receive any further ICP replies.  However, it
	continues to send ICP queries, and will mark the peer as
	alive upon receipt of the first subsequent ICP reply.

	This timeout also affects when Squid expects to receive ICP
	replies from peers.  If more than 'dead_peer' seconds have
	passed since the last ICP reply was received, Squid will not
	expect to receive an ICP reply on the next query.  Thus, if
	your time between requests is greater than this timeout, you
	will see a lot of requests sent DIRECT to origin servers
	instead of to your parents.

DEFAULT: 256 MB
LOC: Config.memMaxSize
DOC_START
	NOTE: THIS PARAMETER DOES NOT SPECIFY THE MAXIMUM PROCESS SIZE.
	IT ONLY PLACES A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL MEMORY SQUID WILL
	USE AS A MEMORY CACHE OF OBJECTS. SQUID USES MEMORY FOR OTHER
	THINGS AS WELL. SEE THE SQUID FAQ SECTION 8 FOR DETAILS.

	'cache_mem' specifies the ideal amount of memory to be used
	for:
		* In-Transit objects
		* Hot Objects
		* Negative-Cached objects

	Data for these objects are stored in 4 KB blocks.  This
	parameter specifies the ideal upper limit on the total size of
	4 KB blocks allocated.  In-Transit objects take the highest
	priority.

	In-transit objects have priority over the others.  When
	additional space is needed for incoming data, negative-cached
	and hot objects will be released.  In other words, the
	negative-cached and hot objects will fill up any unused space
	not needed for in-transit objects.

	If circumstances require, this limit will be exceeded.
	Specifically, if your incoming request rate requires more than
	'cache_mem' of memory to hold in-transit objects, Squid will
	exceed this limit to satisfy the new requests.  When the load
	decreases, blocks will be freed until the high-water mark is
	reached.  Thereafter, blocks will be used to store hot
	objects.

	If shared memory caching is enabled, Squid does not use the shared
	cache space for in-transit objects, but they still consume as much
	local memory as they need. For more details about the shared memory
	cache, see memory_cache_shared.

	Controls whether the memory cache is shared among SMP workers.

	The shared memory cache is meant to occupy cache_mem bytes and replace
	the non-shared memory cache, although some entities may still be
	cached locally by workers for now (e.g., internal and in-transit
	objects may be served from a local memory cache even if shared memory
	caching is enabled).

	By default, the memory cache is shared if and only if all of the
	following conditions are satisfied: Squid runs in SMP mode with
	multiple workers, cache_mem is positive, and Squid environment
	supports required IPC primitives (e.g., POSIX shared memory segments
	and GCC-style atomic operations).

	To avoid blocking locks, shared memory uses opportunistic algorithms
	that do not guarantee that every cachable entity that could have been
	shared among SMP workers will actually be shared.

	    lru       : Squid's original list based LRU policy
	    heap GDSF : Greedy-Dual Size Frequency
	    heap LFUDA: Least Frequently Used with Dynamic Aging
	    heap LRU  : LRU policy implemented using a heap

	Applies to any cache_dir lines listed below this directive.

	The LRU policies keeps recently referenced objects.

	The heap GDSF policy optimizes object hit rate by keeping smaller
	popular objects in cache so it has a better chance of getting a
	hit.  It achieves a lower byte hit rate than LFUDA though since
	it evicts larger (possibly popular) objects.

	The heap LFUDA policy keeps popular objects in cache regardless of
	their size and thus optimizes byte hit rate at the expense of
	hit rate since one large, popular object will prevent many
	smaller, slightly less popular objects from being cached.

	Both policies utilize a dynamic aging mechanism that prevents
	cache pollution that can otherwise occur with frequency-based
	replacement policies.

	NOTE: if using the LFUDA replacement policy you should increase
	the value of maximum_object_size above its default of 4 MB to
	to maximize the potential byte hit rate improvement of LFUDA.

NAME: cache_dir

DEFAULT: none
DEFAULT_DOC: No disk cache. Store cache ojects only in memory.
LOC: Config.cacheSwap
DOC_START
	Format:
		cache_dir Type Directory-Name Fs-specific-data [options]

	You can specify multiple cache_dir lines to spread the
	cache among different disk partitions.

	Type specifies the kind of storage system to use. Only "ufs"
	is built by default. To enable any of the other storage systems
	see the --enable-storeio configure option.

	'Directory' is a top-level directory where cache swap
	files will be stored.  If you want to use an entire disk
	for caching, this can be the mount-point directory.
	The directory must exist and be writable by the Squid
	process.  Squid will NOT create this directory for you.

	In SMP configurations, cache_dir must not precede the workers option
	and should use configuration macros or conditionals to give each
	worker interested in disk caching a dedicated cache directory.


	====  The ufs store type  ====

	"ufs" is the old well-known Squid storage format that has always
	been there.

	Usage:
		cache_dir ufs Directory-Name Mbytes L1 L2 [options]

	'Mbytes' is the amount of disk space (MB) to use under this
	directory.  The default is 100 MB.  Change this to suit your
	configuration.  Do NOT put the size of your disk drive here.
	Instead, if you want Squid to use the entire disk drive,
	subtract 20% and use that value.

	'L1' is the number of first-level subdirectories which
	will be created under the 'Directory'.  The default is 16.

	'L2' is the number of second-level subdirectories which
	will be created under each first-level directory.  The default
	is 256.


	====  The aufs store type  ====

	"aufs" uses the same storage format as "ufs", utilizing
	POSIX-threads to avoid blocking the main Squid process on
	disk-I/O. This was formerly known in Squid as async-io.

	Usage:
		cache_dir aufs Directory-Name Mbytes L1 L2 [options]

	see argument descriptions under ufs above


	====  The diskd store type  ====

	"diskd" uses the same storage format as "ufs", utilizing a
	separate process to avoid blocking the main Squid process on
	disk-I/O.

	Usage:
		cache_dir diskd Directory-Name Mbytes L1 L2 [options] [Q1=n] [Q2=n]

	see argument descriptions under ufs above

	Q1 specifies the number of unacknowledged I/O requests when Squid
	stops opening new files. If this many messages are in the queues,
	Squid won't open new files. Default is 64

	Q2 specifies the number of unacknowledged messages when Squid
	starts blocking.  If this many messages are in the queues,
	Squid blocks until it receives some replies. Default is 72

	When Q1 < Q2 (the default), the cache directory is optimized
	for lower response time at the expense of a decrease in hit
	ratio.  If Q1 > Q2, the cache directory is optimized for
	higher hit ratio at the expense of an increase in response
	time.


	====  The rock store type  ====

	Usage:
	    cache_dir rock Directory-Name Mbytes [options]

	The Rock Store type is a database-style storage. All cached
	entries are stored in a "database" file, using fixed-size slots.
	A single entry occupies one or more slots.

	If possible, Squid using Rock Store creates a dedicated kid
	process called "disker" to avoid blocking Squid worker(s) on disk
	I/O. One disker kid is created for each rock cache_dir.  Diskers
	are created only when Squid, running in daemon mode, has support
	for the IpcIo disk I/O module.

	swap-timeout=msec: Squid will not start writing a miss to or
	reading a hit from disk if it estimates that the swap operation
	will take more than the specified number of milliseconds. By
	default and when set to zero, disables the disk I/O time limit
	enforcement. Ignored when using blocking I/O module because
	blocking synchronous I/O does not allow Squid to estimate the
	expected swap wait time.

	max-swap-rate=swaps/sec: Artificially limits disk access using
	the specified I/O rate limit. Swap out requests that
	would cause the average I/O rate to exceed the limit are
	delayed. Individual swap in requests (i.e., hits or reads) are
	not delayed, but they do contribute to measured swap rate and
	since they are placed in the same FIFO queue as swap out
	requests, they may wait longer if max-swap-rate is smaller.
	This is necessary on file systems that buffer "too
	many" writes and then start blocking Squid and other processes
	while committing those writes to disk.  Usually used together
	with swap-timeout to avoid excessive delays and queue overflows
	when disk demand exceeds available disk "bandwidth". By default
	and when set to zero, disables the disk I/O rate limit
	enforcement. Currently supported by IpcIo module only.

	slot-size=bytes: The size of a database "record" used for
	storing cached responses. A cached response occupies at least
	one slot and all database I/O is done using individual slots so
	increasing this parameter leads to more disk space waste while
	decreasing it leads to more disk I/O overheads. Should be a
	multiple of your operating system I/O page size. Defaults to
	16KBytes. A housekeeping header is stored with each slot and
	smaller slot-sizes will be rejected. The header is smaller than
	100 bytes.


	==== COMMON OPTIONS ====

	no-store	no new objects should be stored to this cache_dir.

	min-size=n	the minimum object size in bytes this cache_dir
			will accept.  It's used to restrict a cache_dir
			to only store large objects (e.g. AUFS) while
			other stores are optimized for smaller objects
			(e.g. Rock).
			Defaults to 0.

	max-size=n	the maximum object size in bytes this cache_dir
			supports.
			The value in maximum_object_size directive sets
			the default unless more specific details are
			available (ie a small store capacity).

	Note: To make optimal use of the max-size limits you should order
	the cache_dir lines with the smallest max-size value first.

NAME: store_dir_select_algorithm
TYPE: string
LOC: Config.store_dir_select_algorithm
DEFAULT: least-load
DOC_START
	How Squid selects which cache_dir to use when the response
	object will fit into more than one.

	Regardless of which algorithm is used the cache_dir min-size
	and max-size parameters are obeyed. As such they can affect
	the selection algorithm by limiting the set of considered
	cache_dir.

	Algorithms:

		least-load

	This algorithm is suited to caches with similar cache_dir
	sizes and disk speeds.

	The disk with the least I/O pending is selected.
	When there are multiple disks with the same I/O load ranking
	the cache_dir with most available capacity is selected.

	When a mix of cache_dir sizes are configured the faster disks
	have a naturally lower I/O loading and larger disks have more
	capacity. So space used to store objects and data throughput
	may be very unbalanced towards larger disks.


		round-robin

	This algorithm is suited to caches with unequal cache_dir
	disk sizes.

	Each cache_dir is selected in a rotation. The next suitable
	cache_dir is used.

	Available cache_dir capacity is only considered in relation
	to whether the object will fit and meets the min-size and
	max-size parameters.

	Disk I/O loading is only considered to prevent overload on slow
	disks. This algorithm does not spread objects by size, so any
	I/O loading per-disk may appear very unbalanced and volatile.

	If several cache_dirs use similar min-size, max-size, or other
	limits to to reject certain responses, then do not group such
	cache_dir lines together, to avoid round-robin selection bias
	towards the first cache_dir after the group. Instead, interleave
	cache_dir lines from different groups. For example:

		store_dir_select_algorithm round-robin
		cache_dir rock /hdd1 ... min-size=100000
		cache_dir rock /ssd1 ... max-size=99999
		cache_dir rock /hdd2 ... min-size=100000
		cache_dir rock /ssd2 ... max-size=99999
		cache_dir rock /hdd3 ... min-size=100000
		cache_dir rock /ssd3 ... max-size=99999

DEFAULT: 0
DEFAULT_DOC: validation disabled
LOC: Config.paranoid_hit_validation
DOC_START
		Controls whether Squid should perform paranoid validation of cache entry
		metadata integrity every time a cache entry is hit. Squid bugs
		notwithstanding, this low-level validation should always succeed. Each
		failed validation results in a cache miss, a BUG line reported to cache.log,
		and the invalid entry marked as unusable (and eventually purged from the
		cache).

		Squid can only validate shared cache memory and rock cache_dir entries.

		Positive paranoid_hit_validation values enable validation and approximate
		the maximum time that Squid is allowed to spend validating a single cache
		hit. Huge values greater or equal to 1 day are considered as no limitation:
		in this case all checks will be performed, regardless of how much time they
		take. Hits are usually stored using 16KB slots (for rock, the size is
		configurable via cache_dir slot-size). Larger hits require scanning more
		slots and, hence, take more time. When validation is enabled, at least one
		slot is always validated, regardless of the configured time limit.

		A worker process validating an entry cannot do anything else (i.e. the
		validation is blocking). The validation overhead is environment dependent,
		but developers have observed Squid spending 3-10 microseconds to check each
		slot of a Rock or shared memory hit entry. If Squid cuts validation short
		because it runs out of configured time, it treats the entry as valid.

		When hit validation is enabled, its statistics is included in Cache
		Manager mgr:counters, mgr:5min, and mgr:60min reports.

 LOGFILE OPTIONS

NAME: logformat
TYPE: logformat
LOC: Log::TheConfig
DEFAULT: none
DEFAULT_DOC: The format definitions squid, common, combined, referrer, useragent are built in.
DOC_START
	Usage:

	logformat <name> <format specification>

	Defines an access log format.

	The <format specification> is a string with embedded % format codes

	% format codes all follow the same basic structure where all
	components but the formatcode are optional and usually unnecessary,
	especially when dealing with common codes.

		% [encoding] [-] [[0]width] [{arg}] formatcode [{arg}]

		encoding escapes or otherwise protects "special" characters:

			"	Quoted string encoding where quote(") and
				backslash(\) characters are \-escaped while
				CR, LF, and TAB characters are encoded as \r,
				\n, and \t two-character sequences.

			[	Custom Squid encoding where percent(%), square
				brackets([]), backslash(\) and characters with
				codes outside of [32,126] range are %-encoded.
				SP is not encoded. Used by log_mime_hdrs.

			#	URL encoding (a.k.a. percent-encoding) where
				all URL unsafe and control characters (per RFC
				1738) are %-encoded.

			/	Shell-like encoding where quote(") and
				backslash(\) characters are \-escaped while CR
				and LF characters are encoded as \r and \n
				two-character sequences. Values containing SP
				character(s) are surrounded by quotes(").

			'	Raw/as-is encoding with no escaping/quoting.

			Default encoding: When no explicit encoding is
			specified, each %code determines its own encoding.
			Most %codes use raw/as-is encoding, but some codes use
			a so called "pass-through URL encoding" where all URL
			unsafe and control characters (per RFC 1738) are
			%-encoded, but the percent character(%) is left as is.

		-	left aligned

		width	minimum and/or maximum field width:
			    [width_min][.width_max]
			When minimum starts with 0, the field is zero-padded.
			String values exceeding maximum width are truncated.

		{arg}	argument such as header name etc. This field may be
			placed before or after the token, but not both at once.

	Format codes:

		%	a literal % character
		sn	Unique sequence number per log line entry
		err_code    The ID of an error response served by Squid or
				a similar internal error identifier.
		err_detail  Additional err_code-dependent error information.
		note	The annotation specified by the argument. Also
			logs the adaptation meta headers set by the
			adaptation_meta configuration parameter.
			If no argument given all annotations logged.
			The argument may include a separator to use with
			annotation values:
                            name[:separator]
			By default, multiple note values are separated with ","
			and multiple notes are separated with "\r\n".
			When logging named notes with %{name}note, the
			explicitly configured separator is used between note
			values. When logging all notes with %note, the
			explicitly configured separator is used between
			individual notes. There is currently no way to
			specify both value and notes separators when logging
			all notes with %note.
		master_xaction  The master transaction identifier is an unsigned
			integer. These IDs are guaranteed to monotonically
			increase within a single worker process lifetime, with
			higher values corresponding to transactions that were
			accepted or initiated later. Due to current implementation
			deficiencies, some IDs are skipped (i.e. never logged).
			Concurrent workers and restarted workers use similar,
			overlapping sequences of master transaction IDs.

	Connection related format codes:

		>a	Client source IP address
		>A	Client FQDN
		>p	Client source port
		>eui	Client source EUI (MAC address, EUI-48 or EUI-64 identifier)
		>la	Local IP address the client connected to
		>lp	Local port number the client connected to
		>qos    Client connection TOS/DSCP value set by Squid
		>nfmark Client connection netfilter packet MARK set by Squid

		transport::>connection_id Identifies a transport connection
			accepted by Squid (e.g., a connection carrying the
			logged HTTP request). Currently, Squid only supports
			TCP transport connections.

			The logged identifier is an unsigned integer. These
			IDs are guaranteed to monotonically increase within a
			single worker process lifetime, with higher values
			corresponding to connections that were accepted later.
			Many IDs are skipped (i.e. never logged). Concurrent
			workers and restarted workers use similar, partially
			overlapping sequences of IDs.

		la	Local listening IP address the client connection was connected to.
		lp	Local listening port number the client connection was connected to.

		<a	Server IP address of the last server or peer connection
		<A	Server FQDN or peer name
		<p	Server port number of the last server or peer connection
		<la	Local IP address of the last server or peer connection
		<lp     Local port number of the last server or peer connection
		<qos	Server connection TOS/DSCP value set by Squid
		<nfmark Server connection netfilter packet MARK set by Squid

		>handshake Raw client handshake
			Initial client bytes received by Squid on a newly
			accepted TCP connection or inside a just established
			CONNECT tunnel. Squid stops accumulating handshake
			bytes as soon as the handshake parser succeeds or
			fails (determining whether the client is using the
			expected protocol).

			For HTTP clients, the handshake is the request line.
			For TLS clients, the handshake consists of all TLS
			records up to and including the TLS record that
			contains the last byte of the first ClientHello
			message. For clients using an unsupported protocol,
			this field contains the bytes received by Squid at the
			time of the handshake parsing failure.

			See the on_unsupported_protocol directive for more
			information on Squid handshake traffic expectations.

			Current support is limited to these contexts:
			- http_port connections, but only when the
			  on_unsupported_protocol directive is in use.
			- https_port connections (and CONNECT tunnels) that
			  are subject to the ssl_bump peek or stare action.

			To protect binary handshake data, this field is always
			base64-encoded (RFC 4648 Section 4). If logformat
			field encoding is configured, that encoding is applied
			on top of base64. Otherwise, the computed base64 value
			is recorded as is.

	Time related format codes:

		ts	Seconds since epoch
		tu	subsecond time (milliseconds)
		tl	Local time. Optional strftime format argument
				default %d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z
		tg	GMT time. Optional strftime format argument
				default %d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z
		tr	Response time (milliseconds)
		dt	Total time spent making DNS lookups (milliseconds)
		tS	Approximate master transaction start time in 
			<full seconds since epoch>.<fractional seconds> format.
			Currently, Squid considers the master transaction
			started when a complete HTTP request header initiating
			the transaction is received from the client. This is
			the same value that Squid uses to calculate transaction
			response time when logging %tr to access.log. Currently,
			Squid uses millisecond resolution for %tS values,
			similar to the default access.log "current time" field
			(%ts.%03tu).

	Access Control related format codes:

		et	Tag returned by external acl
		ea	Log string returned by external acl
		un	User name (any available)
		ul	User name from authentication
		ue	User name from external acl helper
		ui	User name from ident
		un	A user name. Expands to the first available name
			from the following list of information sources:
			- authenticated user name, like %ul
			- user name supplied by an external ACL, like %ue
			- SSL client name, like %us
			- ident user name, like %ui
		credentials Client credentials. The exact meaning depends on
			the authentication scheme: For Basic authentication,
			it is the password; for Digest, the realm sent by the
			client; for NTLM and Negotiate, the client challenge
			or client credentials prefixed with "YR " or "KK ".

	HTTP related format codes:

	    REQUEST

		[http::]rm	Request method (GET/POST etc)
		[http::]>rm	Request method from client
		[http::]<rm	Request method sent to server or peer

		[http::]ru	Request URL received (or computed) and sanitized

				Logs request URI received from the client, a
				request adaptation service, or a request
				redirector (whichever was applied last).

				Computed URLs are URIs of internally generated
				requests and various "error:..." URIs.

				Honors strip_query_terms and uri_whitespace.

				This field is not encoded by default. Encoding
				this field using variants of %-encoding will
				clash with uri_whitespace modifications that
				also use %-encoding.

		[http::]>ru	Request URL received from the client (or computed)

				Computed URLs are URIs of internally generated
				requests and various "error:..." URIs.

				Unlike %ru, this request URI is not affected
				by request adaptation, URL rewriting services,
				and strip_query_terms.

				Honors uri_whitespace.

				This field is using pass-through URL encoding
				by default. Encoding this field using other
				variants of %-encoding will clash with
				uri_whitespace modifications that also use
				%-encoding.

		[http::]<ru	Request URL sent to server or peer
		[http::]>rs	Request URL scheme from client
		[http::]<rs	Request URL scheme sent to server or peer
		[http::]>rd	Request URL domain from client
		[http::]<rd	Request URL domain sent to server or peer
		[http::]>rP	Request URL port from client
		[http::]<rP	Request URL port sent to server or peer
		[http::]rp	Request URL path excluding hostname
		[http::]>rp	Request URL path excluding hostname from client
		[http::]<rp	Request URL path excluding hostname sent to server or peer
		[http::]rv	Request protocol version
		[http::]>rv	Request protocol version from client
		[http::]<rv	Request protocol version sent to server or peer

		[http::]>h	Original received request header.
				Usually differs from the request header sent by
				Squid, although most fields are often preserved.
				Accepts optional header field name/value filter
				argument using name[:[separator]element] format.
		[http::]>ha	Received request header after adaptation and
				redirection (pre-cache REQMOD vectoring point).
				Usually differs from the request header sent by
				Squid, although most fields are often preserved.
				Optional header name argument as for >h

	    RESPONSE

		[http::]<Hs	HTTP status code received from the next hop
		[http::]>Hs	HTTP status code sent to the client

		[http::]<h	Reply header. Optional header name argument
				as for >h

		[http::]mt	MIME content type


	    SIZE COUNTERS

		[http::]st	Total size of request + reply traffic with client
		[http::]>st	Total size of request received from client.
				Excluding chunked encoding bytes.
		[http::]<st	Total size of reply sent to client (after adaptation)

		[http::]>sh	Size of request headers received from client
		[http::]<sh	Size of reply headers sent to client (after adaptation)

		[http::]<sH	Reply high offset sent
		[http::]<sS	Upstream object size

		[http::]<bs	Number of HTTP-equivalent message body bytes 
				received from the next hop, excluding chunked
				transfer encoding and control messages.
				Generated FTP/Gopher listings are treated as
				received bodies.

	    TIMING

		[http::]<pt	Peer response time in milliseconds. The timer starts
				when the last request byte is sent to the next hop
				and stops when the last response byte is received.
		[http::]<tt	Total time in milliseconds. The timer 
				starts with the first connect request (or write I/O)
				sent to the first selected peer. The timer stops
				with the last I/O with the last peer.

	Squid handling related format codes:

		Ss	Squid request status (TCP_MISS etc)
		Sh	Squid hierarchy status (DEFAULT_PARENT etc)

	SSL-related format codes:

		ssl::bump_mode	SslBump decision for the transaction:

				For CONNECT requests that initiated bumping of
				a connection and for any request received on
				an already bumped connection, Squid logs the
				corresponding SslBump mode ("splice", "bump",
				"peek", "stare", "terminate", "server-first"
				or "client-first"). See the ssl_bump option 
				for more information about these modes.

				A "none" token is logged for requests that
				triggered "ssl_bump" ACL evaluation matching
				a "none" rule.

				In all other cases, a single dash ("-") is
				logged.

		ssl::>sni	SSL client SNI sent to Squid.

		ssl::>cert_subject
				The Subject field of the received client
				SSL certificate or a dash ('-') if Squid has
				received an invalid/malformed certificate or
				no certificate at all. Consider encoding the
				logged value because Subject often has spaces.

		ssl::>cert_issuer
				The Issuer field of the received client
				SSL certificate or a dash ('-') if Squid has
				received an invalid/malformed certificate or
				no certificate at all. Consider encoding the
				logged value because Issuer often has spaces.

		ssl::<cert_subject
				The Subject field of the received server
				TLS certificate or a dash ('-') if this is
				not available. Consider encoding the logged
				value because Subject often has spaces.

		ssl::<cert_issuer
				The Issuer field of the received server
				TLS certificate or a dash ('-') if this is
				not available. Consider encoding the logged
				value because Issuer often has spaces.

		ssl::<cert
				The received server x509 certificate in PEM
				format, including BEGIN and END lines (or a
				dash ('-') if the certificate is unavailable).

				WARNING: Large certificates will exceed the
				current 8KB access.log record limit, resulting
				in truncated records. Such truncation usually
				happens in the middle of a record field. The
				limit applies to all access logging modules.

				The logged certificate may have failed
				validation and may not be trusted by Squid.
				This field does not include any intermediate
				certificates that may have been received from
				the server or fetched during certificate
				validation process.

				Currently, Squid only collects server
				certificates during step3 of SslBump
				processing; connections that were not subject
				to ssl_bump rules or that did not match a peek
				or stare rule at step2 will not have the
				server certificate information.

				This field is using pass-through URL encoding
				by default.

		ssl::<cert_errors
				The list of certificate validation errors
				detected by Squid (including OpenSSL and
				certificate validation helper components). The
				errors are listed in the discovery order. By
				default, the error codes are separated by ':'.
				Accepts an optional separator argument.

		%ssl::>negotiated_version The negotiated TLS version of the
				client connection.

		%ssl::<negotiated_version The negotiated TLS version of the
				last server or peer connection.

		%ssl::>received_hello_version The TLS version of the Hello
				message received from TLS client.

		%ssl::<received_hello_version The TLS version of the Hello
				message received from TLS server.

		%ssl::>received_supported_version The maximum TLS version
				supported by the TLS client.

		%ssl::<received_supported_version The maximum TLS version
				supported by the TLS server.

		%ssl::>negotiated_cipher The negotiated cipher of the
				client connection.

		%ssl::<negotiated_cipher The negotiated cipher of the
				last server or peer connection.

	If ICAP is enabled, the following code becomes available (as
	well as ICAP log codes documented with the icap_log option):

		icap::tt        Total ICAP processing time for the HTTP
				transaction. The timer ticks when ICAP
				ACLs are checked and when ICAP
				transaction is in progress.

	If adaptation is enabled the following codes become available:

		adapt::<last_h	The header of the last ICAP response or
				meta-information from the last eCAP
				transaction related to the HTTP transaction.
				Like <h, accepts an optional header name
				argument.

		adapt::sum_trs Summed adaptation transaction response
				times recorded as a comma-separated list in
				the order of transaction start time. Each time
				value is recorded as an integer number,
				representing response time of one or more
				adaptation (ICAP or eCAP) transaction in
				milliseconds.  When a failed transaction is
				being retried or repeated, its time is not
				logged individually but added to the
				replacement (next) transaction. See also:
				adapt::all_trs.

		adapt::all_trs All adaptation transaction response times.
				Same as adaptation_strs but response times of
				individual transactions are never added
				together. Instead, all transaction response
				times are recorded individually.

	You can prefix adapt::*_trs format codes with adaptation
	service name in curly braces to record response time(s) specific
	to that service. For example: %{my_service}adapt::sum_trs

	Format codes related to the PROXY protocol:

		proxy_protocol::>h PROXY protocol header, including optional TLVs.

				Supports the same field and element reporting/extraction logic
				as %http::>h. For configuration and reporting purposes, Squid
				maps each PROXY TLV to an HTTP header field: the TLV type
				(configured as a decimal integer) is the field name, and the
				TLV value is the field value. All TLVs of "LOCAL" connections
				(in PROXY protocol terminology) are currently skipped/ignored.

				Squid also maps the following standard PROXY protocol header
				blocks to pseudo HTTP headers (their names use PROXY
				terminology and start with a colon, following HTTP tradition
				for pseudo headers): :command, :version, :src_addr, :dst_addr,
				:src_port, and :dst_port.

				Without optional parameters, this logformat code logs
				pseudo headers and TLVs.

				This format code uses pass-through URL encoding by default.

				Example:
					# relay custom PROXY TLV #224 to adaptation services
					adaptation_meta Client-Foo "%proxy_protocol::>h{224}"

				See also: %http::>h

	The default formats available (which do not need re-defining) are:

logformat squid      %ts.%03tu %6tr %>a %Ss/%03>Hs %<st %rm %ru %[un %Sh/%<a %mt
logformat common     %>a %[ui %[un [%tl] "%rm %ru HTTP/%rv" %>Hs %<st %Ss:%Sh
logformat combined   %>a %[ui %[un [%tl] "%rm %ru HTTP/%rv" %>Hs %<st "%{Referer}>h" "%{User-Agent}>h" %Ss:%Sh
logformat referrer   %ts.%03tu %>a %{Referer}>h %ru
logformat useragent  %>a [%tl] "%{User-Agent}>h"

	NOTE: When the log_mime_hdrs directive is set to ON.
		The squid, common and combined formats have a safely encoded copy
		of the mime headers appended to each line within a pair of brackets.

	NOTE: The common and combined formats are not quite true to the Apache definition.
		The logs from Squid contain an extra status and hierarchy code appended.

NAME: access_log cache_access_log
TYPE: access_log
LOC: Config.Log.accesslogs
DEFAULT_IF_NONE: daemon:@DEFAULT_ACCESS_LOG@ squid
DOC_START
	Configures whether and how Squid logs HTTP and ICP transactions.
	If access logging is enabled, a single line is logged for every 
	matching HTTP or ICP request. The recommended directive formats are:

	access_log <module>:<place> [option ...] [acl acl ...]
	access_log none [acl acl ...]

	The following directive format is accepted but may be deprecated:
	access_log <module>:<place> [<logformat name> [acl acl ...]]

        In most cases, the first ACL name must not contain the '=' character
	and should not be equal to an existing logformat name. You can always
	start with an 'all' ACL to work around those restrictions.
	
	Will log to the specified module:place using the specified format (which
	must be defined in a logformat directive) those entries which match
	ALL the acl's specified (which must be defined in acl clauses).
	If no acl is specified, all requests will be logged to this destination.
	
	===== Available options for the recommended directive format =====

	logformat=name		Names log line format (either built-in or
				defined by a logformat directive). Defaults
				to 'squid'.

	buffer-size=64KB	Defines approximate buffering limit for log
				records (see buffered_logs).  Squid should not
				keep more than the specified size and, hence,
				should flush records before the buffer becomes
				full to avoid overflows under normal
				conditions (the exact flushing algorithm is
				module-dependent though).  The on-error option
				controls overflow handling.

	on-error=die|drop	Defines action on unrecoverable errors. The
				'drop' action ignores (i.e., does not log)
				affected log records. The default 'die' action
				kills the affected worker. The drop action 
				support has not been tested for modules other
				than tcp.

	rotate=N		Specifies the number of log file rotations to
				make when you run 'squid -k rotate'. The default
				is to obey the logfile_rotate directive. Setting
				rotate=0 will disable the file name rotation,
				but the log files are still closed and re-opened.
				This will enable you to rename the logfiles
				yourself just before sending the rotate signal.
				Only supported by the stdio module.

	===== Modules Currently available =====
	
	none	Do not log any requests matching these ACL.
		Do not specify Place or logformat name.
	
	stdio	Write each log line to disk immediately at the completion of
		each request.
		Place: the filename and path to be written.
	
	daemon	Very similar to stdio. But instead of writing to disk the log
		line is passed to a daemon helper for asychronous handling instead.
		Place: varies depending on the daemon.
		
		log_file_daemon Place: the file name and path to be written.
	
	syslog	To log each request via syslog facility.
		Place: The syslog facility and priority level for these entries.
		Place Format:  facility.priority

		where facility could be any of:
			authpriv, daemon, local0 ... local7 or user.

		And priority could be any of:
			err, warning, notice, info, debug.
	
	udp	To send each log line as text data to a UDP receiver.
		Place: The destination host name or IP and port.
		Place Format:   //host:port

	tcp	To send each log line as text data to a TCP receiver.
		Lines may be accumulated before sending (see buffered_logs).
		Place: The destination host name or IP and port.
		Place Format:   //host:port

NAME: icap_log
TYPE: access_log
IFDEF: ICAP_CLIENT
LOC: Config.Log.icaplogs
DEFAULT: none
DOC_START
	ICAP log files record ICAP transaction summaries, one line per
	transaction.

	The icap_log option format is:
	icap_log <filepath> [<logformat name> [acl acl ...]]
	icap_log none [acl acl ...]]
	
	Please see access_log option documentation for details. The two
	kinds of logs share the overall configuration approach and many
	features.

	ICAP processing of a single HTTP message or transaction may
	require multiple ICAP transactions.  In such cases, multiple
	ICAP transaction log lines will correspond to a single access
	log line.

	ICAP log supports many access.log logformat %codes. In ICAP context,
	HTTP message-related %codes are applied to the HTTP message embedded
	in an ICAP message. Logformat "%http::>..." codes are used for HTTP
	messages embedded in ICAP requests while "%http::<..." codes are used
	for HTTP messages embedded in ICAP responses. For example:

		http::>h	To-be-adapted HTTP message headers sent by Squid to
				the ICAP service. For REQMOD transactions, these are
				HTTP request headers. For RESPMOD, these are HTTP
				response headers, but Squid currently cannot log them
				(i.e., %http::>h will expand to "-" for RESPMOD).

		http::<h	Adapted HTTP message headers sent by the ICAP
				service to Squid (i.e., HTTP request headers in regular
				REQMOD; HTTP response headers in RESPMOD and during
				request satisfaction in REQMOD).

	ICAP OPTIONS transactions do not embed HTTP messages.

	Several logformat codes below deal with ICAP message bodies. An ICAP
	message body, if any, typically includes a complete HTTP message
	(required HTTP headers plus optional HTTP message body). When
	computing HTTP message body size for these logformat codes, Squid
	either includes or excludes chunked encoding overheads; see
	code-specific documentation for details.

	For Secure ICAP services, all size-related information is currently
	computed before/after TLS encryption/decryption, as if TLS was not
	in use at all.

	The following format codes are also available for ICAP logs:

		icap::<A	ICAP server IP address. Similar to <A.

		icap::<service_name	ICAP service name from the icap_service
				option in Squid configuration file.

		icap::ru	ICAP Request-URI. Similar to ru.

		icap::rm	ICAP request method (REQMOD, RESPMOD, or 
				OPTIONS). Similar to existing rm.

		icap::>st	The total size of the ICAP request sent to the ICAP
				server (ICAP headers + ICAP body), including chunking
				metadata (if any).

		icap::<st	The total size of the ICAP response received from the
				ICAP server (ICAP headers + ICAP body), including
				chunking metadata (if any).

		icap::<bs	The size of the ICAP response body received from the
				ICAP server, excluding chunking metadata (if any).

		icap::tr 	Transaction response time (in
				milliseconds).  The timer starts when
				the ICAP transaction is created and
				stops when the transaction is completed.
				Similar to tr.

		icap::tio	Transaction I/O time (in milliseconds). The
				timer starts when the first ICAP request
				byte is scheduled for sending. The timers
				stops when the last byte of the ICAP response
				is received.

		icap::to 	Transaction outcome: ICAP_ERR* for all
				transaction errors, ICAP_OPT for OPTION
				transactions, ICAP_ECHO for 204
				responses, ICAP_MOD for message
				modification, and ICAP_SAT for request
				satisfaction. Similar to Ss.

		icap::Hs	ICAP response status code. Similar to Hs.

		icap::>h	ICAP request header(s). Similar to >h.

		icap::<h	ICAP response header(s). Similar to <h.

	The default ICAP log format, which can be used without an explicit
	definition, is called icap_squid:

logformat icap_squid %ts.%03tu %6icap::tr %>A %icap::to/%03icap::Hs %icap::<st %icap::rm %icap::ru %un -/%icap::<A -

	If have more than one 'cache_dir', and %s is not used in the name
	these swap logs will have names such as:

		cache_swap_log.00
		cache_swap_log.01
		cache_swap_log.02

	The numbered extension (which is added automatically)
	corresponds to the order of the 'cache_dir' lines in this
	configuration file.  If you change the order of the 'cache_dir'
	lines in this file, these index files will NOT correspond to
	the correct 'cache_dir' entry (unless you manually rename

NAME: logfile_rotate
TYPE: int
DEFAULT: 10
LOC: Config.Log.rotateNumber
DOC_START
	Specifies the default number of logfile rotations to make when you
	type 'squid -k rotate'. The default is 10, which will rotate
	with extensions 0 through 9. Setting logfile_rotate to 0 will
	disable the file name rotation, but the logfiles are still closed
	and re-opened. This will enable you to rename the logfiles
	yourself just before sending the rotate signal.

	Note, from Squid-3.1 this option is only a default for cache.log,
	that log can be rotated separately by using debug_options.

	Note, from Squid-4 this option is only a default for access.log
	recorded by stdio: module. Those logs can be rotated separately by
	using the rotate=N option on their access_log directive.

	Note, the 'squid -k rotate' command normally sends a USR1
	signal to the running squid process.  In certain situations
	(e.g. on Linux with Async I/O), USR1 is used for other
	purposes, so -k rotate uses another signal.  It is best to get

	hence, increases the risk of log records loss.

	Note that even when buffered_logs are off, Squid may have to buffer

DOC_START
	Specify the location of the executable URL rewriter to use.
	Since they can perform almost any function there isn't one included.

	For each requested URL, the rewriter will receive on line with the format

	  [channel-ID <SP>] URL [<SP> extras]<NL>

	See url_rewrite_extras on how to send "extras" with optional values to
	the helper.
	After processing the request the helper must reply using the following format:

	  [channel-ID <SP>] result [<SP> kv-pairs]

	The result code can be:

	  OK status=30N url="..."
		Redirect the URL to the one supplied in 'url='.
		'status=' is optional and contains the status code to send
		the client in Squids HTTP response. It must be one of the
		HTTP redirect status codes: 301, 302, 303, 307, 308.
		When no status is given Squid will use 302.

	  OK rewrite-url="..."
		Rewrite the URL to the one supplied in 'rewrite-url='.
		The new URL is fetched directly by Squid and returned to
		the client as the response to its request.

	  OK
		When neither of url= and rewrite-url= are sent Squid does
		not change the URL.

	  ERR
		Do not change the URL.

	  BH
		An internal error occurred in the helper, preventing
		a result being identified. The 'message=' key name is
		reserved for delivering a log message.


	In addition to the above kv-pairs Squid also understands the following
	optional kv-pairs received from URL rewriters:
	  clt_conn_tag=TAG
		Associates a TAG with the client TCP connection.
		The TAG is treated as a regular annotation but persists across
		future requests on the client connection rather than just the
		current request. A helper may update the TAG during subsequent
		requests be returning a new kv-pair.

	When using the concurrency= option the protocol is changed by
	introducing a query channel tag in front of the request/response.
	The query channel tag is a number between 0 and concurrency-1.
	This value must be echoed back unchanged to Squid as the first part
	of the response relating to its request.

	WARNING: URL re-writing ability should be avoided whenever possible.
		 Use the URL redirect form of response instead.

	Re-write creates a difference in the state held by the client
	and server. Possibly causing confusion when the server response
	contains snippets of its view state. Embeded URLs, response
	and content Location headers, etc. are not re-written by this
	interface.

	By default, a URL rewriter is not used.

NAME: url_rewrite_children redirect_children
TYPE: HelperChildConfig
DEFAULT: 20 startup=0 idle=1 concurrency=0
LOC: Config.redirectChildren
DOC_START
	Specifies the maximum number of redirector processes that Squid may
	spawn (numberofchildren) and several related options. Using too few of
	these helper processes (a.k.a. "helpers") creates request queues.
	Using too many helpers wastes your system resources.

	Usage: numberofchildren [option]...

	The startup= and idle= options allow some measure of skew in your
	tuning.
	
		startup=
	
	Sets a minimum of how many processes are to be spawned when Squid
	starts or reconfigures. When set to zero the first request will
	cause spawning of the first child process to handle it.
	
	Starting too few will cause an initial slowdown in traffic as Squid
	attempts to simultaneously spawn enough processes to cope.
	
		idle=
	
	Sets a minimum of how many processes Squid is to try and keep available
	at all times. When traffic begins to rise above what the existing
	processes can handle this many more will be spawned up to the maximum
	configured. A minimum setting of 1 is required.

		concurrency=

	The number of requests each redirector helper can handle in
	parallel. Defaults to 0 which indicates the redirector
	is a old-style single threaded redirector.

	When this directive is set to a value >= 1 then the protocol
	used to communicate with the helper is modified to include
	an ID in front of the request/response. The ID from the request
	must be echoed back with the response to that request.

		queue-size=N

	Sets the maximum number of queued requests. A request is queued when
	no existing child can accept it due to concurrency limit and no new
	child can be started due to numberofchildren limit. The default
	maximum is zero if url_rewrite_bypass is enabled and
	2*numberofchildren otherwise. If the queued requests exceed queue size
	and redirector_bypass configuration option is set, then redirector is
	bypassed. Otherwise, Squid is allowed to temporarily exceed the
	configured maximum, marking the affected helper as "overloaded". If
	the helper overload lasts more than 3 minutes, the action prescribed
	by the on-persistent-overload option applies.

		on-persistent-overload=action

	Specifies Squid reaction to a new helper request arriving when the helper
	has been overloaded for more that 3 minutes already. The number of queued
	requests determines whether the helper is overloaded (see the queue-size
	option).

	Two actions are supported:

	  die	Squid worker quits. This is the default behavior.

	  ERR	Squid treats the helper request as if it was
		immediately submitted, and the helper immediately
		replied with an ERR response. This action has no effect
		on the already queued and in-progress helper requests.

	usage: refresh_pattern [-i] regex min percent max [options]

	By default, regular expressions are CASE-SENSITIVE.  To make
	them case-insensitive, use the -i option.

	'Min' is the time (in minutes) an object without an explicit
	expiry time should be considered fresh. The recommended
	value is 0, any higher values may cause dynamic applications
	to be erroneously cached unless the application designer
	has taken the appropriate actions.

	'Percent' is a percentage of the objects age (time since last
	modification age) an object without explicit expiry time
	will be considered fresh.

	'Max' is an upper limit on how long objects without an explicit
	expiry time will be considered fresh. The value is also used
	to form Cache-Control: max-age header for a request sent from
	Squid to origin/parent.

	options: override-expire
		 override-lastmod
		 reload-into-ims
		 ignore-reload
		 ignore-no-store
		 ignore-private
		 max-stale=NN
		 refresh-ims
		 store-stale

		override-expire enforces min age even if the server
		sent an explicit expiry time (e.g., with the
		Expires: header or Cache-Control: max-age). Doing this
		VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling this feature
		could make you liable for problems which it causes.

		Note: override-expire does not enforce staleness - it only extends
		freshness / min. If the server returns a Expires time which
		is longer than your max time, Squid will still consider
		the object fresh for that period of time.

		override-lastmod enforces min age even on objects
		that were modified recently.

		reload-into-ims changes a client no-cache or ``reload''
		request for a cached entry into a conditional request using
		If-Modified-Since and/or If-None-Match headers, provided the
		cached entry has a Last-Modified and/or a strong ETag header.
		Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard. Enabling this feature
		could make you liable for problems which it causes.

		ignore-reload ignores a client no-cache or ``reload''
		header. Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard. Enabling
		this feature could make you liable for problems which
		it causes.

		ignore-no-store ignores any ``Cache-control: no-store''
		headers received from a server. Doing this VIOLATES
		the HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you
		liable for problems which it causes.

		ignore-private ignores any ``Cache-control: private''
		headers received from a server. Doing this VIOLATES
		the HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you
		liable for problems which it causes.

		refresh-ims causes squid to contact the origin server
		when a client issues an If-Modified-Since request. This
		ensures that the client will receive an updated version
		if one is available.

		store-stale stores responses even if they don't have explicit 
		freshness or a validator (i.e., Last-Modified or an ETag) 
		present, or if they're already stale. By default, Squid will 
		not cache such responses because they usually can't be
		reused. Note that such responses will be stale by default.

		max-stale=NN provide a maximum staleness factor. Squid won't
		serve objects more stale than this even if it failed to
		validate the object. Default: use the max_stale global limit.

	Basically a cached object is:

		FRESH if expire > now, else STALE
		STALE if age > max
		FRESH if lm-factor < percent, else STALE
		FRESH if age < min
		else STALE

	The refresh_pattern lines are checked in the order listed here.
	The first entry which matches is used.  If none of the entries

	If beyond this limit, Squid forwards the Range request as it is and 
	the result is NOT cached.
	
	This is to stop a far ahead range request (lets say start at 17MB)
	from making Squid fetch the whole object up to that point before
	sending anything to the client.
	
	Multiple range_offset_limit lines may be specified, and they will 
	be searched from top to bottom on each request until a match is found. 
	The first match found will be used.  If no line matches a request, the 
	default limit of 0 bytes will be used.
	
	'size' is the limit specified as a number of units.
	
	'units' specifies whether to use bytes, KB, MB, etc.
	If no units are specified bytes are assumed.
	
	A size of 0 causes Squid to never fetch more than the
	client requested. (default)
	
	A size of 'none' causes Squid to always fetch the object from the
	beginning so it may cache the result. (2.0 style)
	
	'aclname' is the name of a defined ACL.

DOC_START
	Usage: request_header_access header_name allow|deny [!]aclname ...

	WARNING: Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling
	this feature could make you liable for problems which it
	causes.

	This option replaces the old 'anonymize_headers' and the
	older 'http_anonymizer' option with something that is much
	more configurable. A list of ACLs for each header name allows
	removal of specific header fields under specific conditions.

	This option only applies to outgoing HTTP request headers (i.e.,
	headers sent by Squid to the next HTTP hop such as a cache peer
	or an origin server). The option has no effect during cache hit
	detection. The equivalent adaptation vectoring point in ICAP
	terminology is post-cache REQMOD.

	The option is applied to individual outgoing request header
	fields. For each request header field F, Squid uses the first
	qualifying sets of request_header_access rules:

	    1. Rules with header_name equal to F's name.
	    2. Rules with header_name 'Other', provided F's name is not
	       on the hard-coded list of commonly used HTTP header names.
	    3. Rules with header_name 'All'.

	Within that qualifying rule set, rule ACLs are checked as usual.
	If ACLs of an "allow" rule match, the header field is allowed to
	go through as is. If ACLs of a "deny" rule match, the header is
	removed and request_header_replace is then checked to identify
	if the removed header has a replacement. If no rules within the
	set have matching ACLs, the header field is left as is.

	For example, to achieve the same behavior as the old
	'http_anonymizer standard' option, you should use:

		request_header_access From deny all
		request_header_access Referer deny all
		request_header_access User-Agent deny all

	Or, to reproduce the old 'http_anonymizer paranoid' feature
	you should use:

		request_header_access Authorization allow all

NAME: collapsed_forwarding
COMMENT: (on|off)
TYPE: onoff
LOC: Config.onoff.collapsed_forwarding
DEFAULT: off
DOC_START
       This option controls whether Squid is allowed to merge multiple
       potentially cachable requests for the same URI before Squid knows
       whether the response is going to be cachable.

       When enabled, instead of forwarding each concurrent request for
       the same URL, Squid just sends the first of them. The other, so
       called "collapsed" requests, wait for the response to the first
       request and, if it happens to be cachable, use that response.
       Here, "concurrent requests" means "received after the first
       request headers were parsed and before the corresponding response
       headers were parsed".

       This feature is disabled by default: enabling collapsed
       forwarding needlessly delays forwarding requests that look
       cachable (when they are collapsed) but then need to be forwarded
       individually anyway because they end up being for uncachable
       content. However, in some cases, such as acceleration of highly
       cachable content with periodic or grouped expiration times, the
       gains from collapsing [large volumes of simultaneous refresh
       requests] outweigh losses from such delays.

       Squid collapses two kinds of requests: regular client requests
       received on one of the listening ports and internal "cache
       revalidation" requests which are triggered by those regular
       requests hitting a stale cached object. Revalidation collapsing
       is currently disabled for Squid instances containing SMP-aware
       disk or memory caches and for Vary-controlled cached objects.

	This directive cannot force collapsing. It has no effect on

	collapsing preconditions are satisfied.

	* A denied request will not collapse, and future transactions will
	  not collapse on it (even if they are allowed to collapse).

TYPE: int64_t
LOC: Config.shared_transient_entries_limit
DEFAULT: 16384
DOC_START
	This directive limits the size of a table used for sharing current
	transaction information among SMP workers. A table entry stores meta
	information about a single cache entry being delivered to Squid
	client(s) by one or more SMP workers. A single table entry consumes
	less than 128 shared memory bytes.

	The limit should be significantly larger than the number of
	concurrent non-collapsed cachable responses leaving Squid. For a
	cache that handles less than 5000 concurrent requests, the default
	setting of 16384 should be plenty.

	Using excessively large values wastes shared memory. Limiting the
	table size too much results in hash collisions, leading to lower hit
	ratio and missed SMP request collapsing opportunities: Transactions
	left without a table entry cannot cache their responses and are
	invisible to other concurrent requests for the same resource.

	A zero limit is allowed but unsupported. A positive small limit
	lowers hit ratio, but zero limit disables a lot of essential
	synchronization among SMP workers, leading to HTTP violations (e.g.,
	stale hit responses). It also disables shared collapsed forwarding:
	A worker becomes unable to collapse its requests on transactions in
	other workers, resulting in more trips to the origin server and more
	cache thrashing.

	and here would be:

	Example:
	    delay_pools 4      # 4 delay pools
	    delay_class 1 2    # pool 1 is a class 2 pool
	    delay_class 2 3    # pool 2 is a class 3 pool
	    delay_class 3 4    # pool 3 is a class 4 pool
	    delay_class 4 5    # pool 4 is a class 5 pool

	The delay pool classes are:

		class 1		Everything is limited by a single aggregate
				bucket.

		class 2 	Everything is limited by a single aggregate
				bucket as well as an "individual" bucket chosen
				from bits 25 through 32 of the IPv4 address.

		class 3		Everything is limited by a single aggregate
				bucket as well as a "network" bucket chosen
				from bits 17 through 24 of the IP address and a
				"individual" bucket chosen from bits 17 through
				32 of the IPv4 address.

		class 4		Everything in a class 3 delay pool, with an
				additional limit on a per user basis. This
				only takes effect if the username is established
				in advance - by forcing authentication in your
				http_access rules.

		class 5		Requests are grouped according their tag (see
				external_acl's tag= reply).


	Each pool also requires a delay_parameters directive to configure the pool size
	and speed limits used whenever the pool is applied to a request. Along with
	a set of delay_access directives to determine when it is used.

	NOTE: If an IP address is a.b.c.d
		-> bits 25 through 32 are "d"
		-> bits 17 through 24 are "c"
		-> bits 17 through 32 are "c * 256 + d"

	NOTE-2: Due to the use of bitmasks in class 2,3,4 pools they only apply to
		IPv4 traffic. Class 1 and 5 pools may be used with IPv6 traffic.

	This clause only supports fast acl types.

IFDEF: USE_DELAY_POOLS
LOC: Config.Delay
DOC_START
	This defines the parameters for a delay pool.  Each delay pool has
	a number of "buckets" associated with it, as explained in the
	description of delay_class.

	For a class 1 delay pool, the syntax is:
		delay_class pool 1
		delay_parameters pool aggregate

	For a class 2 delay pool:
		delay_class pool 2
		delay_parameters pool aggregate individual

	For a class 3 delay pool:
		delay_class pool 3
		delay_parameters pool aggregate network individual

	For a class 4 delay pool:
		delay_class pool 4
		delay_parameters pool aggregate network individual user

	For a class 5 delay pool:
		delay_class pool 5
		delay_parameters pool tagrate

	The option variables are:

		pool		a pool number - ie, a number between 1 and the
				number specified in delay_pools as used in
				delay_class lines.

		aggregate	the speed limit parameters for the aggregate bucket
				(class 1, 2, 3).

		individual	the speed limit parameters for the individual
				buckets (class 2, 3).

		network		the speed limit parameters for the network buckets
				(class 3).

		user		the speed limit parameters for the user buckets
				(class 4).

		tagrate		the speed limit parameters for the tag buckets
				(class 5).

	A pair of delay parameters is written restore/maximum, where restore is
	the number of bytes (not bits - modem and network speeds are usually
	quoted in bits) per second placed into the bucket, and maximum is the
	maximum number of bytes which can be in the bucket at any time.

	There must be one delay_parameters line for each delay pool.


	For example, if delay pool number 1 is a class 2 delay pool as in the
	above example, and is being used to strictly limit each host to 64Kbit/sec
	(plus overheads), with no overall limit, the line is:

		delay_parameters 1 none 8000/8000

	Note that 8 x 8K Byte/sec -> 64K bit/sec.

	Note that the word 'none' is used to represent no limit.


	And, if delay pool number 2 is a class 3 delay pool as in the above
	example, and you want to limit it to a total of 256Kbit/sec (strict limit)
	with each 8-bit network permitted 64Kbit/sec (strict limit) and each
	individual host permitted 4800bit/sec with a bucket maximum size of 64Kbits
	to permit a decent web page to be downloaded at a decent speed
	(if the network is not being limited due to overuse) but slow down
	large downloads more significantly:

		delay_parameters 2 32000/32000 8000/8000 600/8000

	Note that 8 x  32K Byte/sec ->  256K bit/sec.
		  8 x   8K Byte/sec ->   64K bit/sec.
		  8 x 600  Byte/sec -> 4800  bit/sec.


	Finally, for a class 4 delay pool as in the example - each user will
	be limited to 128Kbits/sec no matter how many workstations they are logged into.:

		delay_parameters 4 32000/32000 8000/8000 600/64000 16000/16000

	51 to 255 inclusive.  In order to use a dynamic service id
	one must define the type of traffic to be redirected; this is done
	using the wccp2_service_info option.

	The "standard" type does not require a wccp2_service_info option,
	just specifying the service id will suffice.

	MD5 service authentication can be enabled by adding
	"password=<password>" to the end of this service declaration.

	Examples:

	wccp2_service standard 0	# for the 'web-cache' standard service

	This can be used to return a ERR_ page for requests which
	do not pass the 'http_access' rules.  Squid remembers the last
	acl it evaluated in http_access, and if a 'deny_info' line exists
	for that ACL Squid returns a corresponding error page.

	The acl is typically the last acl on the http_access deny line which
	denied access. The exceptions to this rule are:
	- When Squid needs to request authentication credentials. It's then
	  the first authentication related acl encountered
	- When none of the http_access lines matches. It's then the last
	  acl processed on the last http_access line.
	- When the decision to deny access was made by an adaptation service,
	  the acl name is the corresponding eCAP or ICAP service_name.

	NP: If providing your own custom error pages with error_directory
	    you may also specify them by your custom file name:
	    Example: deny_info ERR_CUSTOM_ACCESS_DENIED bad_guys

	By defaut Squid will send "403 Forbidden". A different 4xx or 5xx
	may be specified by prefixing the file name with the code and a colon.

	Alternatively you can tell Squid to reset the TCP connection
	by specifying TCP_RESET.

	Or you can specify an error URL or URL pattern. The browsers will

TYPE: onoff
LOC: Config.onoff.nonhierarchical_direct
DEFAULT: on
DOC_START
	By default, Squid will send any non-hierarchical requests
	(not cacheable request type) direct to origin servers.

	When this is set to "off", Squid will prefer to send these
	requests to parents.

	Note that in most configurations, by turning this off you will only
	add latency to these request without any improvement in global hit
	ratio.

	This option only sets a preference. If the parent is unavailable a
	direct connection to the origin server may still be attempted. To
	completely prevent direct connections use never_direct.
DOC_END

NAME: prefer_direct
TYPE: onoff
LOC: Config.onoff.prefer_direct
DEFAULT: off
DOC_START
	Normally Squid tries to use parents for most requests. If you for some
	reason like it to first try going direct and only use a parent if
	going direct fails set this to on.

	By combining nonhierarchical_direct off and prefer_direct on you
	can set up Squid to use a parent as a backup path if going direct
	fails.

	Note: If you want Squid to use parents for all requests see
	the never_direct directive. prefer_direct only modifies how Squid
	acts on cacheable requests.
DOC_END

NAME: cache_miss_revalidate
COMMENT: on|off
TYPE: onoff
DEFAULT: on
LOC: Config.onoff.cache_miss_revalidate
DOC_START
	RFC 7232 defines a conditional request mechanism to prevent
	response objects being unnecessarily transferred over the network.
	If that mechanism is used by the client and a cache MISS occurs
	it can prevent new cache entries being created.

	This option determines whether Squid on cache MISS will pass the
	client revalidation request to the server or tries to fetch new
	content for caching. It can be useful while the cache is mostly
	empty to more quickly have the cache populated by generating
	non-conditional GETs.

	When set to 'on' (default), Squid will pass all client If-* headers
	to the server. This permits server responses without a cacheable
	payload to be delivered and on MISS no new cache entry is created.

	When set to 'off' and if the request is cacheable, Squid will
	remove the clients If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match headers from
	the request sent to the server. This requests a 200 status response
	from the server to create a new cache entry with.
DOC_END

NAME: always_direct
TYPE: acl_access
LOC: Config.accessList.AlwaysDirect
DEFAULT: none
DEFAULT_DOC: Prevent any cache_peer being used for this request.
DOC_START
	Usage: always_direct allow|deny [!]aclname ...

	Here you can use ACL elements to specify requests which should
	ALWAYS be forwarded by Squid to the origin servers without using
	any peers.  For example, to always directly forward requests for
	local servers ignoring any parents or siblings you may have use
	something like:

		acl local-servers dstdomain my.domain.net
		always_direct allow local-servers

	To always forward FTP requests directly, use

		acl FTP proto FTP
		always_direct allow FTP

	NOTE: There is a similar, but opposite option named
	'never_direct'.  You need to be aware that "always_direct deny
	foo" is NOT the same thing as "never_direct allow foo".  You
	may need to use a deny rule to exclude a more-specific case of
	some other rule.  Example:

		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
		acl local-servers dstdomain  .foo.net
		always_direct deny local-external
		always_direct allow local-servers

	NOTE: If your goal is to make the client forward the request
	directly to the origin server bypassing Squid then this needs
	to be done in the client configuration. Squid configuration
	can only tell Squid how Squid should fetch the object.

	NOTE: This directive is not related to caching. The replies
	is cached as usual even if you use always_direct. To not cache
	the replies see the 'cache' directive.

	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.
	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.

DOC_START
	Usage: never_direct allow|deny [!]aclname ...

	never_direct is the opposite of always_direct.  Please read
	the description for always_direct if you have not already.

	With 'never_direct' you can use ACL elements to specify
	requests which should NEVER be forwarded directly to origin
	servers.  For example, to force the use of a proxy for all
	requests, except those in your local domain use something like:

		acl local-servers dstdomain .foo.net
		never_direct deny local-servers
		never_direct allow all

	or if Squid is inside a firewall and there are local intranet
	servers inside the firewall use something like:

		acl local-intranet dstdomain .foo.net
		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
		always_direct deny local-external
		always_direct allow local-intranet
		never_direct allow all

	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.

DOC_START
	The limit specifies the number of failures that Squid tolerates
	when establishing a new TCP connection with an ICAP service. If
	the number of failures exceeds the limit, the ICAP service is
	not used for new ICAP requests until it is time to refresh its
	OPTIONS.

	A negative value disables the limit. Without the limit, an ICAP
	service will not be considered down due to connectivity failures
	between ICAP OPTIONS requests.

	Squid forgets ICAP service failures older than the specified
	value of memory-depth. The memory fading algorithm 
	is approximate because Squid does not remember individual 
	errors but groups them instead, splitting the option
	value into ten time slots of equal length.

	When memory-depth is 0 and by default this option has no 
	effect on service failure expiration.

	Squid always forgets failures when updating service settings
	using an ICAP OPTIONS transaction, regardless of this option

DOC_START
	Defines a single ICAP service using the following format:

	icap_service id vectoring_point uri [option ...]

	id: ID
		an opaque identifier or name which is used to direct traffic to
		this specific service. Must be unique among all adaptation
		services in squid.conf.

	vectoring_point: reqmod_precache|reqmod_postcache|respmod_precache|respmod_postcache
		This specifies at which point of transaction processing the
		ICAP service should be activated. *_postcache vectoring points
		are not yet supported.

	uri: icap://servername:port/servicepath
		ICAP server and service location.
	     icaps://servername:port/servicepath
		The "icap:" URI scheme is used for traditional ICAP server and
		service location (default port is 1344, connections are not
		encrypted). The "icaps:" URI scheme is for Secure ICAP
		services that use SSL/TLS-encrypted ICAP connections (by
		default, on port 11344).

	ICAP does not allow a single service to handle both REQMOD and RESPMOD
	transactions. Squid does not enforce that requirement. You can specify
	services with the same service_url and different vectoring_points. You
	can even specify multiple identical services as long as their
	service_names differ.

	To activate a service, use the adaptation_access directive. To group
	services, use adaptation_service_chain and adaptation_service_set.

	Service options are separated by white space. ICAP services support
	the following name=value options:

	bypass=on|off|1|0
		If set to 'on' or '1', the ICAP service is treated as
		optional. If the service cannot be reached or malfunctions,
		Squid will try to ignore any errors and process the message as
		if the service was not enabled. No all ICAP errors can be
		bypassed.  If set to 0, the ICAP service is treated as
		essential and all ICAP errors will result in an error page
		returned to the HTTP client.

		Bypass is off by default: services are treated as essential.

	routing=on|off|1|0
		If set to 'on' or '1', the ICAP service is allowed to
		dynamically change the current message adaptation plan by
		returning a chain of services to be used next. The services
		are specified using the X-Next-Services ICAP response header
		value, formatted as a comma-separated list of service names.
		Each named service should be configured in squid.conf. Other
		services are ignored. An empty X-Next-Services value results
		in an empty plan which ends the current adaptation.

		Dynamic adaptation plan may cross or cover multiple supported
		vectoring points in their natural processing order.

		Routing is not allowed by default: the ICAP X-Next-Services
		response header is ignored.

	ipv6=on|off
		Only has effect on split-stack systems. The default on those systems
		is to use IPv4-only connections. When set to 'on' this option will
		make Squid use IPv6-only connections to contact this ICAP service.

	on-overload=block|bypass|wait|force
		If the service Max-Connections limit has been reached, do
		one of the following for each new ICAP transaction:
		  * block:  send an HTTP error response to the client
		  * bypass: ignore the "over-connected" ICAP service
		  * wait:   wait (in a FIFO queue) for an ICAP connection slot
		  * force:  proceed, ignoring the Max-Connections limit 

		In SMP mode with N workers, each worker assumes the service
		connection limit is Max-Connections/N, even though not all
		workers may use a given service.

		The default value is "bypass" if service is bypassable,
		otherwise it is set to "wait".
		

	max-conn=number
		Use the given number as the Max-Connections limit, regardless
		of the Max-Connections value given by the service, if any.

	connection-encryption=on|off
		Determines the ICAP service effect on the connections_encrypted
		ACL.

		The default is "on" for Secure ICAP services (i.e., those
		with the icaps:// service URIs scheme) and "off" for plain ICAP
		services.

		Does not affect ICAP connections (e.g., does not turn Secure
		ICAP on or off).

	==== ICAPS / TLS OPTIONS ====

	These options are used for Secure ICAP (icaps://....) services only.

	tls-cert=/path/to/ssl/certificate
			A client X.509 certificate to use when connecting to
			this ICAP server.

	tls-key=/path/to/ssl/key
			The private key corresponding to the previous
			tls-cert= option.

			If tls-key= is not specified tls-cert= is assumed to
			reference a PEM file containing both the certificate
			and private key.

	tls-cipher=...	The list of valid TLS/SSL ciphers to use when connecting

	tls-min-version=1.N
			The minimum TLS protocol version to permit. To control

        id: ID
		an opaque identifier or name which is used to direct traffic to
		this specific service. Must be unique among all adaptation
		services in squid.conf.

	vectoring_point: reqmod_precache|reqmod_postcache|respmod_precache|respmod_postcache
		This specifies at which point of transaction processing the
		eCAP service should be activated. *_postcache vectoring points
		are not yet supported.

	uri: ecap://vendor/service_name?custom&cgi=style&parameters=optional
		Squid uses the eCAP service URI to match this configuration
		line with one of the dynamically loaded services. Each loaded
		eCAP service must have a unique URI. Obtain the right URI from
		the service provider.

	To activate a service, use the adaptation_access directive. To group
	services, use adaptation_service_chain and adaptation_service_set.

	Service options are separated by white space. eCAP services support
	the following name=value options:

	bypass=on|off|1|0
		If set to 'on' or '1', the eCAP service is treated as optional.
		If the service cannot be reached or malfunctions, Squid will try
		to ignore any errors and process the message as if the service
		was not enabled. No all eCAP errors can be bypassed.
		If set to 'off' or '0', the eCAP service is treated as essential
		and all eCAP errors will result in an error page returned to the
		HTTP client.

                Bypass is off by default: services are treated as essential.

	routing=on|off|1|0
		If set to 'on' or '1', the eCAP service is allowed to
		dynamically change the current message adaptation plan by
		returning a chain of services to be used next.

		Dynamic adaptation plan may cross or cover multiple supported
		vectoring points in their natural processing order.

		Routing is not allowed by default.

	connection-encryption=on|off
		Determines the eCAP service effect on the connections_encrypted
		ACL. 

		Defaults to "on", which does not taint the master transaction
		w.r.t. that ACL.

		Does not affect eCAP API calls.

	Older ecap_service format without optional named parameters is

	Configures an ordered set of similar, redundant services. This is
	useful when hot standby or backup adaptation servers are available.

	    adaptation_service_set set_name service_name1 service_name2 ...

 	The named services are used in the set declaration order. The first
	applicable adaptation service from the set is used first. The next
	applicable service is tried if and only if the transaction with the
	previous service fails and the message waiting to be adapted is still
	intact.

	When adaptation starts, broken services are ignored as if they were
	not a part of the set. A broken service is a down optional service.

	The services in a set must be attached to the same vectoring point
	(e.g., pre-cache) and use the same adaptation method (e.g., REQMOD).

	If all services in a set are optional then adaptation failures are
	bypassable. If all services in the set are essential, then a
	transaction failure with one service may still be retried using
	another service from the set, but when all services fail, the master
	transaction fails as well.

	A set may contain a mix of optional and essential services, but that
	is likely to lead to surprising results because broken services become
	ignored (see above), making previously bypassable failures fatal.
	Technically, it is the bypassability of the last failed service that

 	The named services are used in the chain declaration order. The first
	applicable adaptation service from the chain is used first. The next
	applicable service is applied to the successful adaptation results of
	the previous service in the chain.

	When adaptation starts, broken services are ignored as if they were
	not a part of the chain. A broken service is a down optional service.

	Request satisfaction terminates the adaptation chain because Squid
	does not currently allow declaration of RESPMOD services at the
	"reqmod_precache" vectoring point (see icap_service or ecap_service).

	The services in a chain must be attached to the same vectoring point
	(e.g., pre-cache) and use the same adaptation method (e.g., REQMOD).

	A chain may contain a mix of optional and essential services. If an
	essential adaptation fails (or the failure cannot be bypassed for
	other reasons), the master transaction fails. Otherwise, the failure
	is bypassed as if the failed adaptation service was not in the chain.

LOC: Adaptation::Config::masterx_shared_name
DEFAULT: none
DOC_START
	For each master transaction (i.e., the HTTP request and response
	sequence, including all related ICAP and eCAP exchanges), Squid
	maintains a table of metadata. The table entries are (name, value)
	pairs shared among eCAP and ICAP exchanges. The table is destroyed
	with the master transaction.

	This option specifies the table entry names that Squid must accept
	from and forward to the adaptation transactions.

	An ICAP REQMOD or RESPMOD transaction may set an entry in the 
	shared table by returning an ICAP header field with a name 
	specified in adaptation_masterx_shared_names.

	An eCAP REQMOD or RESPMOD transaction may set an entry in the
	shared table by implementing the libecap::visitEachOption() API
	to provide an option with a name specified in
	adaptation_masterx_shared_names.

	Squid will store and forward the set entry to subsequent adaptation
	transactions within the same master transaction scope.

	Only one shared entry name is supported at this time.

Example:
# share authentication information among ICAP services

DOC_END

NAME: adaptation_meta
TYPE: note
IFDEF: USE_ADAPTATION
LOC: Adaptation::Config::metaHeaders

	This option allows Squid administrator to add custom ICAP request
	headers or eCAP options to Squid ICAP requests or eCAP transactions.
	Use it to pass custom authentication tokens and other
	transaction-state related meta information to an ICAP/eCAP service.
	
	The addition of a meta header is ACL-driven:
		adaptation_meta name value [!]aclname ...
	
	Processing for a given header name stops after the first ACL list match.
	Thus, it is impossible to add two headers with the same name. If no ACL
	lists match for a given header name, no such header is added. For 
	example:
	
		# do not debug transactions except for those that need debugging
		adaptation_meta X-Debug 1 needs_debugging
	
		# log all transactions except for those that must remain secret
		adaptation_meta X-Log 1 !keep_secret
	
		# mark transactions from users in the "G 1" group
		adaptation_meta X-Authenticated-Groups "G 1" authed_as_G1
	
	The "value" parameter may be a regular squid.conf token or a "double
	quoted string". Within the quoted string, use backslash (\) to escape
	any character, which is currently only useful for escaping backslashes
	and double quotes. For example,
	    "this string has one backslash (\\) and two \"quotes\""

	Used adaptation_meta header values may be logged via %note
	logformat code. If multiple adaptation_meta headers with the same name
	are used during master transaction lifetime, the header values are
	logged in the order they were used and duplicate values are ignored
	(only the first repeated value will be logged).

	For legacy reasons DNS UDP replies will default to 512 bytes which

	negotiate receiving larger responses back immediately without having
	to failover with repeat requests. Responses larger than this limit
	will retain the old behaviour of failover to TCP DNS.
	
	Squid has no real fixed limit internally, but allowing packet sizes
	over 1500 bytes requires network jumbogram support and is usually not
	necessary.
	
	WARNING: The RFC also indicates that some older resolvers will reply
	with failure of the whole request if the extension is added. Some
	resolvers have already been identified which will reply with mangled
	EDNS response on occasion. Usually in response to many-KB jumbogram

NAME: connect_retries
TYPE: int
LOC: Config.connect_retries
DEFAULT: 0
DEFAULT_DOC: Do not retry failed connections.
DOC_START
	Limits the number of reopening attempts when establishing a single
	TCP connection. All these attempts must still complete before the
	applicable connection opening timeout expires.

	By default and when connect_retries is set to zero, Squid does not
	retry failed connection opening attempts.

	The (not recommended) maximum is 10 tries. An attempt to configure a
	higher value results in the value of 10 being used (with a warning).

	Squid may open connections to retry various high-level forwarding
	failures. For an outside observer, that activity may look like a
	low-level connection reopening attempt, but those high-level retries
	are governed by forward_max_tries instead.

	See also: connect_timeout, forward_timeout, icap_connect_timeout,
	ident_timeout, and forward_max_tries.

DOC_START
	If set to ON Squid will automatically retry requests when
	receiving an error response with status 403 (Forbidden),
	500 (Internal Error), 501 or 503 (Service not available).
	Status 502 and 504 (Gateway errors) are always retried.
	
	This is mainly useful if you are in a complex cache hierarchy to
	work around access control errors.
	
	NOTE: This retry will attempt to find another working destination.
	Which is different from the server which just failed.

NAME: uri_whitespace
TYPE: uri_whitespace
LOC: Config.uri_whitespace
DEFAULT: strip
DOC_START
	What to do with requests that have whitespace characters in the
	URI.  Options:

	strip:  The whitespace characters are stripped out of the URL.
		This is the behavior recommended by RFC2396 and RFC3986
		for tolerant handling of generic URI.
		NOTE: This is one difference between generic URI and HTTP URLs.

	deny:   The request is denied.  The user receives an "Invalid
		Request" message.
		This is the behaviour recommended by RFC2616 for safe
		handling of HTTP request URL.

	allow:  The request is allowed and the URI is not changed.  The
		whitespace characters remain in the URI.  Note the
		whitespace is passed to redirector processes if they
		are in use.
		Note this may be considered a violation of RFC2616
		request parsing where whitespace is prohibited in the
		URL field.

	encode:	The request is allowed and the whitespace characters are
		encoded according to RFC1738.

	chop:	The request is allowed and the URI is chopped at the
		first whitespace.


	NOTE the current Squid implementation of encode and chop violates
	RFC2616 by not using a 301 redirect after altering the URL.

NAME: chroot
TYPE: string
LOC: Config.chroot_dir
DEFAULT: none
DOC_START
	Specifies a directory where Squid should do a chroot() while
	initializing.  This also causes Squid to fully drop root
	privileges after initializing.  This means, for example, if you
	use a HTTP port less than 1024 and try to reconfigure, you may
	get an error saying that Squid can not open the port.

DEFAULT_DOC: Do not pre-parse pipelined requests.
DOC_START
	HTTP clients may send a pipeline of 1+N requests to Squid using a
	single connection, without waiting for Squid to respond to the first
	of those requests. This option limits the number of concurrent
	requests Squid will try to handle in parallel. If set to N, Squid
	will try to receive and process up to 1+N requests on the same
	connection concurrently.

	Defaults to 0 (off) for bandwidth management and access logging

DOC_START
	When this is set to a non-zero value, the main Squid process

NAME: force_request_body_continuation
TYPE: acl_access
LOC: Config.accessList.forceRequestBodyContinuation
DEFAULT: none
DEFAULT_DOC: Deny, unless rules exist in squid.conf.
DOC_START
	This option controls how Squid handles data upload requests from HTTP
	and FTP agents that require a "Please Continue" control message response
	to actually send the request body to Squid. It is mostly useful in
	adaptation environments.
	
	When Squid receives an HTTP request with an "Expect: 100-continue"
	header or an FTP upload command (e.g., STOR), Squid normally sends the
	request headers or FTP command information to an adaptation service (or
	peer) and waits for a response. Most adaptation services (and some
	broken peers) may not respond to Squid at that stage because they may
	decide to wait for the HTTP request body or FTP data transfer. However,
	that request body or data transfer may never come because Squid has not
	responded with the HTTP 100 or FTP 150 (Please Continue) control message
	to the request sender yet!
	
	An allow match tells Squid to respond with the HTTP 100 or FTP 150
	(Please Continue) control message on its own, before forwarding the
	request to an adaptation service or peer. Such a response usually forces
	the request sender to proceed with sending the body. A deny match tells
	Squid to delay that control response until the origin server confirms
	that the request body is needed. Delaying is the default behavior.
DOC_END

NAME: server_pconn_for_nonretriable
TYPE: acl_access
DEFAULT: none
DEFAULT_DOC: Open new connections for forwarding requests Squid cannot retry safely.
LOC: Config.accessList.serverPconnForNonretriable
DOC_START
	This option provides fine-grained control over persistent connection
	reuse when forwarding HTTP requests that Squid cannot retry. It is useful
	in environments where opening new connections is very expensive
	(e.g., all connections are secured with TLS with complex client and server
	certificate validation) and race conditions associated with persistent
	connections are very rare and/or only cause minor problems.

	HTTP prohibits retrying unsafe and non-idempotent requests (e.g., POST).
	Squid limitations also prohibit retrying all requests with bodies (e.g., PUT).
	By default, when forwarding such "risky" requests, Squid opens a new
	connection to the server or cache_peer, even if there is an idle persistent
	connection available. When Squid is configured to risk sending a non-retriable
	request on a previously used persistent connection, and the server closes
	the connection before seeing that risky request, the user gets an error response
	from Squid. In most cases, that error response will be HTTP 502 (Bad Gateway)
	with ERR_ZERO_SIZE_OBJECT or ERR_WRITE_ERROR (peer connection reset) error detail.

	If an allow rule matches, Squid reuses an available idle persistent connection
	(if any) for the request that Squid cannot retry. If a deny rule matches, then
	Squid opens a new connection for the request that Squid cannot retry.

	This option does not affect requests that Squid can retry. They will reuse idle
	persistent connections (if any).

	This clause only supports fast acl types.
	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.

NAME: happy_eyeballs_connect_timeout
COMMENT: (msec)
TYPE: int
DEFAULT: 250
LOC: Config.happyEyeballs.connect_timeout
DOC_START
	This Happy Eyeballs (RFC 8305) tuning directive specifies the minimum
	delay between opening a primary to-server connection and opening a
	spare to-server connection for the same master transaction. This delay
	is similar to the Connection Attempt Delay in RFC 8305, but it is only
	applied to the first spare connection attempt. Subsequent spare
	connection attempts use happy_eyeballs_connect_gap, and primary
	connection attempts are not artificially delayed at all.

	Terminology: The "primary" and "spare" designations are determined by
	the order of DNS answers received by Squid: If Squid DNS AAAA query
	was answered first, then primary connections are connections to IPv6
	peer addresses (while spare connections use IPv4 addresses).
	Similarly, if Squid DNS A query was answered first, then primary
	connections are connections to IPv4 peer addresses (while spare
	connections use IPv6 addresses).

	Shorter happy_eyeballs_connect_timeout values reduce master
	transaction response time, potentially improving user-perceived
	response times (i.e., making user eyeballs happier). Longer delays
	reduce both concurrent connection level and server bombardment with
	connection requests, potentially improving overall Squid performance
	and reducing the chance of being blocked by servers for opening too
	many unused connections.

	RFC 8305 prohibits happy_eyeballs_connect_timeout values smaller than
	10 (milliseconds) to "avoid congestion collapse in the presence of
	high packet-loss rates".

	The following Happy Eyeballs directives place additional connection
	opening restrictions: happy_eyeballs_connect_gap and
	happy_eyeballs_connect_limit.
DOC_END

NAME: happy_eyeballs_connect_gap
COMMENT: (msec)
TYPE: int
DEFAULT: -1
DEFAULT_DOC: no artificial delays between spare attempts
LOC: Config.happyEyeballs.connect_gap
DOC_START
	This Happy Eyeballs (RFC 8305) tuning directive specifies the
	minimum delay between opening spare to-server connections (to any
	server; i.e. across all concurrent master transactions in a Squid
	instance). Each SMP worker currently multiplies the configured gap
	by the total number of workers so that the combined spare connection
	opening rate of a Squid instance obeys the configured limit. The
	workers do not coordinate connection openings yet; a micro burst
	of spare connection openings may violate the configured gap.

	This directive has similar trade-offs as
	happy_eyeballs_connect_timeout, but its focus is on limiting traffic
	amplification effects for Squid as a whole, while
	happy_eyeballs_connect_timeout works on an individual master
	transaction level.

	The following Happy Eyeballs directives place additional connection
	opening restrictions: happy_eyeballs_connect_timeout and
	happy_eyeballs_connect_limit. See the former for related terminology.

NAME: happy_eyeballs_connect_limit
TYPE: int
DEFAULT: -1
DEFAULT_DOC: no artificial limit on the number of concurrent spare attempts
LOC: Config.happyEyeballs.connect_limit
DOC_START
	This Happy Eyeballs (RFC 8305) tuning directive specifies the
	maximum number of spare to-server connections (to any server; i.e.
	across all concurrent master transactions in a Squid instance).
	Each SMP worker gets an equal share of the total limit. However,
	the workers do not share the actual connection counts yet, so one
	(busier) worker cannot "borrow" spare connection slots from another
	(less loaded) worker.

	Setting this limit to zero disables concurrent use of primary and
	spare TCP connections: Spare connection attempts are made only after
	all primary attempts fail. However, Squid would still use the
	DNS-related optimizations of the Happy Eyeballs approach.

	This directive has similar trade-offs as happy_eyeballs_connect_gap,
	but its focus is on limiting Squid overheads, while
	happy_eyeballs_connect_gap focuses on the origin server and peer
	overheads.

	The following Happy Eyeballs directives place additional connection
	opening restrictions: happy_eyeballs_connect_timeout and
	happy_eyeballs_connect_gap. See the former for related terminology.
