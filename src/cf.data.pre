DOC_START
	This tag specifies a list of multicast groups which your server
	should join to receive multicasted ICP requests.

	NOTE!  Be very careful what you put here!  Be sure you
	understand the difference between an ICP _query_ and an ICP
	_reply_.  This option is to be set only if you want to RECEIVE
	multicast queries.  Do NOT set this option to SEND multicast
	ICP (use cache_peer for that).  ICP replies are always sent via
	unicast, so this option does not affect whether or not you will
	receive replies from multicast group members.

	You must be very careful to NOT use a multicast address which
	is already in use by another group of caches.  NLANR has been
	assigned a block of multicast address space for use in Web
	Caching.  Plese write to us at nlanr-cache@nlanr.net to receive
	an address for your own use.

	If you are unsure about multicast, please read the Multicast
	chapter in the Squid FAQ (http://squid.nlanr.net/Squid/FAQ/).

	Usage: mcast_groups 239.128.16.128 224.0.1.20

	By default, Squid doesn't listen on any multicast groups.

 OPTIONS WHICH AFFECT THE NEIGHBOR SELECTION ALGORITHM
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENT_END

NAME: cache_peer
TYPE: peer
DEFAULT: none
LOC: Config.peers
DOC_START
	To specify other caches in a hierarchy, use the format:

		hostname type http_port icp_port

	For example,

	#                                        proxy  icp
	#          hostname             type     port   port  options
	#          -------------------- -------- ----- -----  -----------
	cache_peer parent.foo.net       parent    3128  3130  [proxy-only]
	cache_peer sib1.foo.net         sibling   3128  3130  [proxy-only]
	cache_peer sib2.foo.net         sibling   3128  3130  [proxy-only]

	      type:  either 'parent', 'sibling', or 'multicast'.

	proxy_port:  The port number where the cache listens for proxy
		     requests.

	  icp_port:  Used for querying neighbor caches about
		     objects.  To have a non-ICP neighbor
		     specify '7' for the ICP port and make sure the
		     neighbor machine has the UDP echo port
		     enabled in its /etc/inetd.conf file.

	    options: proxy-only
		     weight=n
		     ttl=n
		     no-query
		     default
		     round-robin
		     multicast-responder
		     closest-only
		     no-netdb-exchange
		     no-delay

		     use 'proxy-only' to specify that objects fetched
		     from this cache should not be saved locally.

		     use 'weight=n' to specify a weighted parent.
		     The weight must be an integer.  The default weight
		     is 1, larger weights are favored more.

		     use 'ttl=n' to specify a IP multicast TTL to use
		     when sending an ICP request to this address.
		     Only useful when sending to a multicast group.
		     Because we don't accept ICP replies from random
		     hosts, you must configure other group members as
		     peers with the 'multicast-responder' option below.

		     use 'no-query' to NOT send ICP queries to this
		     neighbor.

		     use 'default' if this is a parent cache which can
		     be used as a "last-resort." You should probably
		     only use 'default' in situations where you cannot
		     use ICP with your parent cache(s).

		     use 'round-robin' to define a set of parents which
		     should be used in a round-robin fashion in the
		     absence of any ICP queries.

		     'multicast-responder' indicates that the named peer
		     is a member of a multicast group.  ICP queries will
		     not be sent directly to the peer, but ICP replies
		     will be accepted from it.

		     'closest-only' indicates that, for ICP_OP_MISS
		     replies, we'll only forward CLOSEST_PARENT_MISSes
		     and never FIRST_PARENT_MISSes.

		     'no-netdb-exchange' disables requesting ICMP
		     RTT database (NetDB) from the neighbor.

		     use 'no-delay' to prevent access to this neighbor
		     from influencing the delay pools.

	NOTE: non-ICP neighbors must be specified as 'parent'.

NAME: cache_peer_domain cache_host_domain
TYPE: hostdomain
DEFAULT: none
LOC: none
DOC_START
	Use to limit the domains for which a neighbor cache will be
	queried.  Usage:

	cache_peer_domain cache-host domain [domain ...]
	cache_peer_domain cache-host !domain

	For example, specifying

		cache_peer_domain parent.foo.net	.edu

	has the effect such that UDP query packets are sent to
	'bigserver' only when the requested object exists on a
	server in the .edu domain.  Prefixing the domainname
	with '!' means that the cache will be queried for objects
	NOT in that domain.

	NOTE:	* Any number of domains may be given for a cache-host,
		  either on the same or separate lines.
		* When multiple domains are given for a particular
		  cache-host, the first matched domain is applied.
		* Cache hosts with no domain restrictions are queried
		  for all requests.
		* There are no defaults.
		* There is also a 'cache_peer_access' tag in the ACL
		  section.

NAME: neighbor_type_domain
TYPE: hostdomaintype
DEFAULT: none

DOC_START
	usage: neighbor_type_domain parent|sibling domain domain ...

	Modifying the neighbor type for specific domains is now
	possible.  You can treat some domains differently than the the
	default neighbor type specified on the 'cache_peer' line.
	Normally it should only be necessary to list domains which
	should be treated differently because the default neighbor type
	applies for hostnames which do not match domains listed here.

EXAMPLE:
	cache_peer  parent cache.foo.org 3128 3130
	neighbor_type_domain cache.foo.org sibling .com .net
	neighbor_type_domain cache.foo.org sibling .au .de

NAME: icp_query_timeout
COMMENT: (msec)
DEFAULT: 0
TYPE: int
LOC: Config.Timeout.icp_query
DOC_START
	Normally Squid will automatically determine an optimal ICP
	query timeout value based on the round-trip-time of recent ICP
	queries.  If you want to override the value determined by
	Squid, set this 'icp_query_timeout' to a non-zero value.  This
	value is specified in MILLISECONDS, so, to use a 2-second
	timeout (the old default), you would write:

		icp_query_timeout 2000

icp_query_timeout 0
DOC_END

NAME: mcast_icp_query_timeout
COMMENT: (msec)
DEFAULT: 2000
TYPE: int
LOC: Config.Timeout.mcast_icp_query
DOC_START
	For Multicast peers, Squid regularly sends out ICP "probes" to
	count how many other peers are listening on the given multicast
	address.  This value specifies how long Squid should wait to
	count all the replies.  The default is 2000 msec, or 2
	seconds.

DOC_END

NAME: dead_peer_timeout
COMMENT: (seconds)
DEFAULT: 10 seconds
TYPE: time_t
LOC: Config.Timeout.deadPeer
DOC_START
	This controls how long Squid waits to declare a peer cache
	as "dead."  If there are no ICP replies received in this
	amount of time, Squid will declare the peer dead and not
	expect to receive any further ICP replies.  However, it
	continues to send ICP queries, and will mark the peer as
	alive upon receipt of the first subsequent ICP reply.

	The default is to directly fetch URLs containing 'cgi-bin' or '?'.

NAME: no_cache
TYPE: acl_access

LOC: Config.accessList.noCache
DOC_START
	A list of ACL elements which, if matched, cause the reply to

	to force certain objects to never be cached.

	You must use the word 'DENY' to indicate the ACL names which should
	NOT be cached.

	There is no default.  We recommend you uncomment the following
	two lines.

COMMENT: (bytes)
TYPE: b_size_t
DEFAULT: 8 MB
LOC: Config.Mem.maxSize
DOC_START
	NOTE: THIS PARAMETER DOES NOT SPECIFY THE MAXIMUM PROCESS
	SIZE.  IT PLACES A LIMIT ON ONE ASPECT OF SQUID'S MEMORY
	USAGE.  SQUID USES MEMORY FOR OTHER THINGS AS WELL.
	YOUR PROCESS WILL PROBABLY BECOME TWICE OR THREE TIMES
	BIGGER THAN THE VALUE YOU PUT HERE 

	'cache_mem' specifies the ideal amount of memory to be used
	for:
		* In-Transit objects
		* Hot Objects
		* Negative-Cached objects

	Data for these objects are stored in 4 KB blocks.  This
	parameter specifies the ideal upper limit on the total size of
	4 KB blocks allocated.  In-Transit objects take the highest
	priority.

	In-transit objects have priority over the others.  When
	additional space is needed for incoming data, negative-cached
	and hot objects will be released.  In other words, the
	negative-cached and hot objects will fill up any unused space
	not needed for in-transit objects.

	If circumstances require, this limit will be exceeded.
	Specifically, if your incoming request rate requires more than
	'cache_mem' of memory to hold in-transit objects, Squid will
	exceed this limit to satisfy the new requests.  When the load
	decreases, blocks will be freed until the high-water mark is
	reached.  Thereafter, blocks will be used to store hot
	objects.

	The values of cache_mem_low and cache_mem_high (below) can be
	used to tune the use of the memory pool.  When the high mark is
	reached, in-transit and hot objects will be released to clear
	space.  When an object transfer is completed, it will remain in
	memory only if the current memory usage is below the low water
	mark.

	The default is 8 Megabytes.

	client would ever need to be connected to your cache.  You
	should probably change client_lifetime only as a last resort.

COMMENT: (bytes)
TYPE: b_size_t
DEFAULT: none
LOC: Config.MemPools.limit
DOC_START
	Used only with memory_pools on:
	memory_pools_limit 50 MB

	If set to a non-zero value, Squid will keep at most the specified
	limit of allocated (but unused) memory in memory pools. All free()
	requests that exceed this limit will be handled by your malloc
	library. Squid does not pre-allocate any memory, just safe-keeps
	objects that otherwise would be free()d. Thus, it is safe to set
	memory_pools_limit to a reasonably high value even if your
	configuration will use less memory.

	If not set (default) or set to zero, Squid will keep all memory it
	can. That is, there will be no limit on the total amount of memory
	used for safe-keeping.

	To disable memory allocation optimization, do not set
	memory_pools_limit to 0. Set memory_pools to "off" instead.

	An overhead for maintaining memory pools is not taken into account
	when the limit is checked. This overhead is close to four bytes per
	object kept. However, pools may actually _save_ memory because of
	reduced memory thrashing in your malloc library.

	Here you can use ACL elements to specify requests which should

	to always directly forward requests for local servers use
	something like:

		acl local-servers dstdomain my.domain.net
		always_direct allow local-servers

	To always forward FTP requests directly, use

		acl FTP proto FTP
		always_direct allow FTP

	NOTE: There is a similar, but opposite option named
	'never_direct'.  You need to be aware that "always_direct deny
	foo" is NOT the same thing as "never_direct allow foo".  You
	may need to use a deny rule to exclude a more-specific case of
	some other rule.  Example:

		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
		acl local-servers dstdomain  foo.net
		always_direct deny local-external
		always_direct allow local-servers

	never_direct is the opposite of always_direct.  Please read
	the description for always_direct if you have not already.

	With 'never_direct' you can use ACL elements to specify
	requests which should NEVER be forwarded directly to origin
	servers.  For example, to force the use of a proxy for all
	requests, except those in your local domain use something like:

		acl local-servers dstdomain foo.net
		acl all src 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
		never_direct deny local-servers
		never_direct allow all
	
	or if squid is inside a firewall and there is local intranet
	servers inside the firewall then use something like:

		acl local-intranet dstdomain foo.net
		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
		always_direct deny local-external
		always_direct allow local-intranet
		never_direct allow all

	This specifies the minimum connect timeout, for when the

	When a connection to a host is initiated, and that host has
	several IP addresses, the default connection timeout is reduced
	by dividing it by the number of addresses.  So, a site with 15
	addresses would then have a timeout of 8 seconds for each
	address attempted.  To avoid having the timeout reduced to the
	point where even a working host would not have a chance to
	respond, this setting is provided.  The default, and the
