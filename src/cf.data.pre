COMMENT_START
	WELCOME TO SQUID 2
	------------------

	This is the default Squid configuration file. You may wish
	to look at the Squid home page (http://www.squid-cache.org/)
	for the FAQ and other documentation.

	The default Squid config file shows what the defaults for
	various options happen to be.  If you don't need to change the
	default, you shouldn't uncomment the line.  Doing so may cause
	run-time problems.  In some cases "none" refers to no default
	setting at all, while in other cases it refers to a valid
	option - the comments for that keyword indicate if this is the
	case.

NAME: http_port ascii_port
TYPE: sockaddr_in_list
DEFAULT: none
DEFAULT_IF_NONE: 3128
LOC: Config.Sockaddr.http
DOC_START
	Usage:	port
		hostname:port
		1.2.3.4:port

	The socket addresses where Squid will listen for HTTP client
	requests.  You may specify multiple socket addresses.
	There are three forms: port alone, hostname with port, and
	IP address with port.  If you specify a hostname or IP
	address, then Squid binds the socket to that specific
	address.  This replaces the old 'tcp_incoming_address'
	option.  Most likely, you do not need to bind to a specific
	address, so you can use the port number alone.

	The default port number is 3128.

	If you are running Squid in accelerator mode, then you
	probably want to listen on port 80 also, or instead.

	The -a command line option will override the *first* port
	number listed here.   That option will NOT override an IP
	address, however.

	You may specify multiple socket addresses on multiple lines.

        Usage:  [ip:]port cert=certificate.pem [key=key.pem] [options...]

        The socket address where Squid will listen for HTTPS client
        requests.

        This is really only useful for situations where you are running
        squid in accelerator mode and you want to do the SSL work at the
        accelerator level.

	You may specify multiple socket addresses on multiple lines,
	each with their own SSL certificate and/or options.
			      
	Options:

	   cert=	Path to SSL certificate (PEM format)
		
	   key=		Path to SSL private key file (PEM format)
			if not specified, the certificate file is
			assumed to be a combined certificate and
			key file

	   version=	The version of SSL/TLS supported
			    1	automatic (default)
			    2	SSLv2 only
			    3	SSLv3 only
			    4	TLSv1 only

	   cipher=	Colon separated list of supported ciphers

	   options=	Varions SSL engine options. The most important
			being:
			    NO_SSLv2  Disallow the use of SSLv2
			    NO_SSLv3  Disallow the use of SSLv3
			    NO_TLSv1  Disallow the use of TLSv1

NAME: mcast_groups
TYPE: wordlist
LOC: Config.mcast_group_list
DEFAULT: none
DOC_START
	This tag specifies a list of multicast groups which your server
	should join to receive multicasted ICP queries.

	NOTE!  Be very careful what you put here!  Be sure you
	understand the difference between an ICP _query_ and an ICP
	_reply_.  This option is to be set only if you want to RECEIVE
	multicast queries.  Do NOT set this option to SEND multicast
	ICP (use cache_peer for that).  ICP replies are always sent via
	unicast, so this option does not affect whether or not you will
	receive replies from multicast group members.

	You must be very careful to NOT use a multicast address which
	is already in use by another group of caches.

	If you are unsure about multicast, please read the Multicast
	chapter in the Squid FAQ (http://www.squid-cache.org/FAQ/).

	Usage: mcast_groups 239.128.16.128 224.0.1.20

	By default, Squid doesn't listen on any multicast groups.

DOC_START
	Usage: tcp_incoming_address 10.20.30.40
	       udp_outgoing_address fully.qualified.domain.name

	udp_incoming_address	is used for the ICP socket receiving packets
				from other caches.
	udp_outgoing_address	is used for ICP packets sent out to other
				caches.

	The default behavior is to not bind to any specific address.

	A *_incoming_address value of 0.0.0.0 indicates that Squid should
	listen on all available interfaces.

	If udp_outgoing_address is set to 255.255.255.255 (the default)
	then it will use the same socket as udp_incoming_address. Only
	change this if you want to have ICP queries sent using another
	address than where this Squid listens for ICP queries from other
	caches.

	NOTE, udp_incoming_address and udp_outgoing_address can not
	have the same value since they both use port 3130.

	NOTE, tcp_incoming_address has been removed.  You can now
	specify IP addresses on the 'http_port' line.

 OPTIONS WHICH AFFECT THE NEIGHBOR SELECTION ALGORITHM
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENT_END

NAME: cache_peer
TYPE: peer
DEFAULT: none
LOC: Config.peers
DOC_START
	To specify other caches in a hierarchy, use the format:

		cache_peer hostname type http_port icp_port

	For example,

	#                                        proxy  icp
	#          hostname             type     port   port  options
	#          -------------------- -------- ----- -----  -----------
	cache_peer parent.foo.net       parent    3128  3130  [proxy-only]
	cache_peer sib1.foo.net         sibling   3128  3130  [proxy-only]
	cache_peer sib2.foo.net         sibling   3128  3130  [proxy-only]

	      type:  either 'parent', 'sibling', or 'multicast'.

	proxy_port:  The port number where the cache listens for proxy
		     requests.

	  icp_port:  Used for querying neighbor caches about
		     objects.  To have a non-ICP neighbor
		     specify '7' for the ICP port and make sure the
		     neighbor machine has the UDP echo port
		     enabled in its /etc/inetd.conf file.

	    options: proxy-only
		     weight=n
		     ttl=n
		     no-query
		     default
		     round-robin
		     multicast-responder
		     closest-only
		     no-digest
		     no-netdb-exchange
		     no-delay
		     login=user:password | PASS | *:password
		     connect-timeout=nn
		     digest-url=url
		     allow-miss
		     max-conn

		     use 'proxy-only' to specify that objects fetched
		     from this cache should not be saved locally.

		     use 'weight=n' to specify a weighted parent.
		     The weight must be an integer.  The default weight
		     is 1, larger weights are favored more.

		     use 'ttl=n' to specify a IP multicast TTL to use
		     when sending an ICP queries to this address.
		     Only useful when sending to a multicast group.
		     Because we don't accept ICP replies from random
		     hosts, you must configure other group members as
		     peers with the 'multicast-responder' option below.

		     use 'no-query' to NOT send ICP queries to this
		     neighbor.

		     use 'default' if this is a parent cache which can
		     be used as a "last-resort." You should probably
		     only use 'default' in situations where you cannot
		     use ICP with your parent cache(s).

		     use 'round-robin' to define a set of parents which
		     should be used in a round-robin fashion in the
		     absence of any ICP queries.

		     'multicast-responder' indicates that the named peer
		     is a member of a multicast group.  ICP queries will
		     not be sent directly to the peer, but ICP replies
		     will be accepted from it.

		     'closest-only' indicates that, for ICP_OP_MISS
		     replies, we'll only forward CLOSEST_PARENT_MISSes
		     and never FIRST_PARENT_MISSes.

		     use 'no-digest' to NOT request cache digests from
		     this neighbor.

		     'no-netdb-exchange' disables requesting ICMP
		     RTT database (NetDB) from the neighbor.

		     use 'no-delay' to prevent access to this neighbor
		     from influencing the delay pools.

		     use 'login=user:password' if this is a personal/workgroup
		     proxy and your parent requires proxy authentication.
		     Note: The string can include URL escapes (i.e. %20 for
		     spaces). This also means that % must be written as %%.

		     use 'login=PASS' if users must authenticate against
		     the upstream proxy. This will pass the users credentials
		     as they are to the peer proxy. This only works for the
		     Basic HTTP authentication sheme. Note: To combine this
		     with proxy_auth both proxies must share the same user
		     database as HTTP only allows for one proxy login.
		     Also be warned that this will expose your users proxy
		     password to the peer. USE WITH CAUTION

		     use 'login=*:password' to pass the username to the
		     upstream cache, but with a fixed password. This is meant
		     to be used when the peer is in another administrative
		     domain, but it is still needed to identify each user.
		     The star can optionally be followed by some extra
		     information which is added to the username. This can
		     be used to identify this proxy to the peer, similar to
		     the login=username:password option above.

		     use 'connect-timeout=nn' to specify a peer
		     specific connect timeout (also see the
		     peer_connect_timeout directive)

		     use 'digest-url=url' to tell Squid to fetch the cache
		     digest (if digests are enabled) for this host from
		     the specified URL rather than the Squid default
		     location.

		     use 'allow-miss' to disable Squid's use of only-if-cached
		     when forwarding requests to siblings. This is primarily
		     useful when icp_hit_stale is used by the sibling. To
		     extensive use of this option may result in forwarding
		     loops, and you should avoid having two-way peerings
		     with this option. (for example to deny peer usage on
		     requests from peer by denying cache_peer_access if the
		     source is a peer)

		     use 'max-conn' to limit the amount of connections Squid
		     may open to this peer.

	NOTE: non-ICP neighbors must be specified as 'parent'.

NAME: cache_peer_domain cache_host_domain
TYPE: hostdomain
DEFAULT: none
LOC: none
DOC_START
	Use to limit the domains for which a neighbor cache will be
	queried.  Usage:

	cache_peer_domain cache-host domain [domain ...]
	cache_peer_domain cache-host !domain

	For example, specifying

		cache_peer_domain parent.foo.net	.edu

	has the effect such that UDP query packets are sent to
	'bigserver' only when the requested object exists on a
	server in the .edu domain.  Prefixing the domainname
	with '!' means that the cache will be queried for objects
	NOT in that domain.

	NOTE:	* Any number of domains may be given for a cache-host,
		  either on the same or separate lines.
		* When multiple domains are given for a particular
		  cache-host, the first matched domain is applied.
		* Cache hosts with no domain restrictions are queried
		  for all requests.
		* There are no defaults.
		* There is also a 'cache_peer_access' tag in the ACL
		  section.

	Modifying the neighbor type for specific domains is now
	possible.  You can treat some domains differently than the the
	default neighbor type specified on the 'cache_peer' line.
	Normally it should only be necessary to list domains which
	should be treated differently because the default neighbor type
	applies for hostnames which do not match domains listed here.

EXAMPLE:

NAME: icp_query_timeout
COMMENT: (msec)
DEFAULT: 0
TYPE: int
LOC: Config.Timeout.icp_query
DOC_START
	Normally Squid will automatically determine an optimal ICP
	query timeout value based on the round-trip-time of recent ICP
	queries.  If you want to override the value determined by
	Squid, set this 'icp_query_timeout' to a non-zero value.  This
	value is specified in MILLISECONDS, so, to use a 2-second
	timeout (the old default), you would write:

		icp_query_timeout 2000
DOC_END

NAME: maximum_icp_query_timeout
COMMENT: (msec)
DEFAULT: 2000
TYPE: int
LOC: Config.Timeout.icp_query_max
DOC_START
	Normally the ICP query timeout is determined dynamically.  But
	sometimes it can lead to very large values (say 5 seconds).
	Use this option to put an upper limit on the dynamic timeout
	value.  Do NOT use this option to always use a fixed (instead
	of a dynamic) timeout value. To set a fixed timeout see the
	'icp_query_timeout' directive.
DOC_END

NAME: mcast_icp_query_timeout
COMMENT: (msec)
DEFAULT: 2000
TYPE: int
LOC: Config.Timeout.mcast_icp_query
DOC_START
	For Multicast peers, Squid regularly sends out ICP "probes" to
	count how many other peers are listening on the given multicast
	address.  This value specifies how long Squid should wait to
	count all the replies.  The default is 2000 msec, or 2
	seconds.
DOC_END

NAME: dead_peer_timeout
COMMENT: (seconds)
DEFAULT: 10 seconds
TYPE: time_t
LOC: Config.Timeout.deadPeer
DOC_START
	This controls how long Squid waits to declare a peer cache
	as "dead."  If there are no ICP replies received in this
	amount of time, Squid will declare the peer dead and not
	expect to receive any further ICP replies.  However, it
	continues to send ICP queries, and will mark the peer as
	alive upon receipt of the first subsequent ICP reply.

	This timeout also affects when Squid expects to receive ICP
	replies from peers.  If more than 'dead_peer' seconds have
	passed since the last ICP reply was received, Squid will not
	expect to receive an ICP reply on the next query.  Thus, if
	your time between requests is greater than this timeout, you
	will see a lot of requests sent DIRECT to origin servers
	instead of to your parents.

DOC_START
	NOTE: THIS PARAMETER DOES NOT SPECIFY THE MAXIMUM PROCESS
	SIZE.  IT PLACES A LIMIT ON ONE ASPECT OF SQUID'S MEMORY
	USAGE.  SQUID USES MEMORY FOR OTHER THINGS AS WELL.
	YOUR PROCESS WILL PROBABLY BECOME TWICE OR THREE TIMES
	BIGGER THAN THE VALUE YOU PUT HERE

	'cache_mem' specifies the ideal amount of memory to be used
	for:
		* In-Transit objects
		* Hot Objects
		* Negative-Cached objects

	Data for these objects are stored in 4 KB blocks.  This
	parameter specifies the ideal upper limit on the total size of
	4 KB blocks allocated.  In-Transit objects take the highest
	priority.

	In-transit objects have priority over the others.  When
	additional space is needed for incoming data, negative-cached
	and hot objects will be released.  In other words, the
	negative-cached and hot objects will fill up any unused space
	not needed for in-transit objects.

	If circumstances require, this limit will be exceeded.
	Specifically, if your incoming request rate requires more than
	'cache_mem' of memory to hold in-transit objects, Squid will
	exceed this limit to satisfy the new requests.  When the load
	decreases, blocks will be freed until the high-water mark is
	reached.  Thereafter, blocks will be used to store hot

	    heap LFUDA: Least Frequently Used with Dynamic Aging
	    heap LRU  : LRU policy implemented using a heap

	Applies to any cache_dir lines listed below this.

	The LRU policies keeps recently referenced objects.

	The heap GDSF policy optimizes object hit rate by keeping smaller
	popular objects in cache so it has a better chance of getting a
	hit.  It achieves a lower byte hit rate than LFUDA though since
	it evicts larger (possibly popular) objects.

	The heap LFUDA policy keeps popular objects in cache regardless of
	their size and thus optimizes byte hit rate at the expense of
	hit rate since one large, popular object will prevent many
	smaller, slightly less popular objects from being cached.

	Both policies utilize a dynamic aging mechanism that prevents
	cache pollution that can otherwise occur with frequency-based
	replacement policies.

	NOTE: if using the LFUDA replacement policy you should increase
	the value of maximum_object_size above its default of 4096 KB to
	to maximize the potential byte hit rate improvement of LFUDA.

	'Mbytes' is the amount of disk space (MB) to use under this
	directory.  The default is 100 MB.  Change this to suit your
	configuration.

	'Level-1' is the number of first-level subdirectories which
	will be created under the 'Directory'.  The default is 16.

	'Level-2' is the number of second-level subdirectories which
	will be created under each first-level directory.  The default
	is 256.

	The aufs store type:

	"aufs" uses the same storage format as "ufs", utilizing
	POSIX-threads to avoid blocking the main Squid process on
	disk-I/O. This was formerly known in Squid as async-io.

	cache_dir aufs Directory-Name Mbytes L1 L2 [options]

	see argument descriptions under ufs above

	The diskd store type:

	"diskd" uses the same storage format as "ufs", utilizing a
	separate process to avoid blocking the main Squid process on
	disk-I/O.

	cache_dir diskd Directory-Name Mbytes L1 L2 [options] [Q1=n] [Q2=n]

	see argument descriptions under ufs above

	Q1 specifies the number of unacknowledged I/O requests when Squid
	stops opening new files. If this many messages are in the queues,
	Squid won't open new files. Default is 64

	Q2 specifies the number of unacknowledged messages when Squid
	starts blocking.  If this many messages are in the queues,
	Squid blocks until it recevies some replies. Default is 72

	Common options:

	read-only, this cache_dir is read only.

	max-size=n, refers to the max object size this storedir supports.
	It is used to initially choose the storedir to dump the object.
	Note: To make optimal use of the max-size limits you should order
	the cache_dir lines with the smallest max-size value first and the
	ones with no max-size specification last.

NAME: cache_swap_log
TYPE: string
LOC: Config.Log.swap
DEFAULT: none
DOC_START
	Location for the cache "swap.log."  This log file holds the
	metadata of objects saved on disk.  It is used to rebuild the
	cache during startup.  Normally this file resides in each
	'cache_dir' directory, but you may specify an alternate
	pathname here.  Note you must give a full filename, not just
	a directory. Since this is the index for the whole object
	list you CANNOT periodically rotate it!

	If %s can be used in the file name then it will be replaced with a
	a representation of the cache_dir name where each / is replaced
	with '.'. This is needed to allow adding/removing cache_dir
	lines when cache_swap_log is being used.
	
	If have more than one 'cache_dir', and %s is not used in the name
	then these swap logs will have names such as:

		cache_swap_log.00
		cache_swap_log.01
		cache_swap_log.02

	The numbered extension (which is added automatically)
	corresponds to the order of the 'cache_dir' lines in this
	configuration file.  If you change the order of the 'cache_dir'
	lines in this file, then these log files will NOT correspond to
	the correct 'cache_dir' entry (unless you manually rename
	them).  We recommend that you do NOT use this option.  It is
	better to keep these log files in each 'cache_dir' directory.

	format: auth_param scheme parameter [setting]
	
	auth_param basic program @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/bin/ncsa_auth @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/etc/passwd	
	would tell the basic authentication scheme it's program parameter.

	The order that authentication prompts are presented to the client_agent
	is dependant on the order the scheme first appears in config file.
	IE has a bug (it's not rfc 2617 compliant) in that it will use the basic
	scheme if basic is the first entry presented, even if more secure schemes
	are presented. For now use the order in the file below. If other browsers
	have difficulties (don't recognise the schemes offered even if you are using
	basic) then either put basic first, or disable the other schemes (by commenting
	out their program entry).

	Once an authentication scheme is fully configured, it can only be shutdown
	by shutting squid down and restarting. Changes can be made on the fly and
	activated with a reconfigure. I.E. You can change to a different helper,
	but not unconfigure the helper completely.

	=== Parameters for the basic scheme follow. ===
	
	"program" cmdline
	Specify the command for the external authenticator.  Such a
	program reads a line containing "username password" and replies
	"OK" or "ERR" in an endless loop.  If you use an authenticator,
	make sure you have 1 acl of type proxy_auth.  By default, the
	authenticate_program is not used.

	If you want to use the traditional proxy authentication,
	jump over to the ../auth_modules/NCSA directory and
	type:
		% make
		% make install

	Then, set this line to something like

	auth_param basic program @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/bin/ncsa_auth @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/etc/passwd

	"children" numberofchildren
	The number of authenticator processes to spawn (no default). If you
	start too few Squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog
	of usercode/password verifications, slowing it down. When password
	verifications are done via a (slow) network you are likely to need
	lots of authenticator processes.
	auth_param basic children 5

	"realm" realmstring
	Specifies the realm name which is to be reported to the client for
	the basic proxy authentication scheme (part of the text the user will
	see when prompted their username and password). Their is no default.
	auth_param basic realm Squid proxy-caching web server

	"credentialsttl" timetolive
	Specifies how long squid assumes an externally validated username:password
	pair is valid for - in other words how often the helper program is called
	for that user. Set this low to force revalidation with short lived passwords.
	Note that setting this high does not impact your susceptability to replay
	attacks unless you are using a one-time password system (such as SecureID).
	If you are using such a system, you will be vulnerable to replay attacks
	unless you also enable the IP ttl is strict option.

	=== Parameters for the digest scheme follow ===

	"program" cmdline
	Specify the command for the external authenticator.  Such a
	program reads a line containing "username":"realm" and replies
	with the appropriate H(A1) value base64 encoded. See rfc 2616 for
	the definition of H(A1).  If you use an authenticator,
	make sure you have 1 acl of type proxy_auth.  By default,
	authentication is not used.

	If you want to use build a authenticator,
	jump over to the ../digest_auth_modules directory and choose the
	authenticator to use. It it's directory type
        	% make
	        % make install

	Then, set this line to something like

	auth_param digest program @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/bin/digest_auth_pw @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/etc/digpass


	"children" numberofchildren
	The number of authenticator processes to spawn (no default). If you
	start too few Squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog
	of H(A1) calculations, slowing it down. When the H(A1) calculations
	are done via a (slow) network you are likely to need lots of
	authenticator processes.
	auth_param digest children 5

	"realm" realmstring
	Specifies the realm name which is to be reported to the client for
	the digest proxy authentication scheme (part of the text the user will
	see when prompted their username and password). There is no default.
	auth_param digest realm Squid proxy-caching web server

	"nonce_garbage_interval" timeinterval
	Specifies the interval that nonces that have been issued to client_agent's
	are checked for validity.

	"nonce_max_duration" timeinterval
	Specifies the maximum length of time a given nonce will be valid for.

	"nonce_max_count" number
	Specifies the maximum number of times a given nonce can be used.

	=== NTLM scheme options follow ===

	"program" cmdline
	Specify the command for the external ntlm authenticator.  Such a
	program reads a line containing the uuencoded NEGOTIATE and replies
	with the ntlm CHALLENGE, then waits for the response and answers with
	"OK" or "ERR" in an endless loop.  If you use an ntlm authenticator,
	make sure you have 1 acl of type proxy_auth.  By default, the
	ntlm authenticator_program is not used.

	auth_param ntlm program @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/bin/ntlm_auth

	"children" numberofchildren
	The number of authenticator processes to spawn (no default). If you
	start too few Squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog
	of credential verifications, slowing it down. When crendential
	verifications are done via a (slow) network you are likely to need
	lots of authenticator processes.
	auth_param ntlm children 5

	"max_challenge_reuses" number
	The maximum number of times a challenge given by a ntlm authentication
	helper can be reused. Increasing this number increases your exposure
	to replay attacks on your network. 0 means use the challenge only once.
	(disable challenge caching)
	See max_ntlm_challenge_lifetime for more information.
	auth_param ntlm max_challenge_reuses 0

	"max_challenge_lifetime" timespan
	The maximum time period that a ntlm challenge is reused over.

LOC: Config.authenticateIpTTL
DEFAULT: 0 seconds
DOC_START
	With this option you control how long a proxy authentication
	will be bound to a specific IP address. If a request using
	the same user name is received during this time then access
	will be denied and both users are required to reauthenticate
	them selves.  The idea behind this is to make it annoying
	for people to share their password to their friends, but
	yet allow a dialup user to reconnect on a different dialup
	port.

	The default is 0 to disable the check. Recommended value
	if you have dialup users are no more than 60 seconds to allow
	the user to redial without hassle. If all your users are
	stationary then higher values may be used.

	usage: refresh_pattern [-i] regex min percent max [options]

	By default, regular expressions are CASE-SENSITIVE.  To make
	them case-insensitive, use the -i option.

	'Min' is the time (in minutes) an object without an explicit
	expiry time should be considered fresh. The recommended
	value is 0, any higher values may cause dynamic applications
	to be erroneously cached unless the application designer
	has taken the appropriate actions.

	'Percent' is a percentage of the objects age (time since last
	modification age) an object without explicit expiry time
	will be considered fresh.

	'Max' is an upper limit on how long objects without an explicit
	expiry time will be considered fresh.

	options: overrsde-expire
		 override-lastmod
		 reload-into-ims
		 ignore-reload

		override-expire enforces min age even if the server
		sent a Expires: header. Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP
		standard.  Enabling this feature could make you liable
		for problems which it causes.

		override-lastmod enforces min age even on objects
		that was modified recently.

		reload-into-ims changes client no-cache or ``reload''
		to If-Modified-Since requests. Doing this VIOLATES the
		HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you
		liable for problems which it causes.

		ignore-reload ignores a client no-cache or ``reload''
		header. Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard. Enabling
		this feature could make you liable for problems which
		it causes.
		
	Please see the file doc/Release-Notes-1.1.txt for a full
	description of Squid's refresh algorithm.  Basically a
	cached object is: (the order is changed from 1.1.X)

		FRESH if expires < now, else STALE
		STALE if age > max
		FRESH if lm-factor < percent, else STALE
		FRESH if age < min
		else STALE

	The refresh_pattern lines are checked in the order listed here.
	The first entry which matches is used.  If none of the entries

LOC: Config.referenceAge
DEFAULT: 1 year
DOC_START
	As a part of normal operation, Squid performs Least Recently

	computed dynamically, based on the amount of disk space in
	use.  The dynamic value can be seen in the Cache Manager 'info'
	output.

	The 'reference_age' parameter defines the maximum LRU age.  For
	example, setting reference_age to '1 week' will cause objects
	to be removed if they have not been accessed for a week or
	more.  The default value is one year.

	Specify a number here, followed by units of time.  For example:
		1 week

DOC_START
	The cache by default continues downloading aborted requests
	which are almost completed (less than 16 KB remaining). This
	may be undesirable on slow (e.g. SLIP) links and/or very busy
	caches.  Impatient users may tie up file descriptors and
	bandwidth by repeatedly requesting and immediately aborting
	downloads.

	When the user aborts a request, Squid will check the
	quick_abort values to the amount of data transfered until
	then.

	If the transfer has less than 'quick_abort_min' KB remaining,
	it will finish the retrieval.

	If the transfer has more than 'quick_abort_max' KB remaining,
	it will abort the retrieval.

	If more than 'quick_abort_pct' of the transfer has completed,
	it will finish the retrieval.

	If you do not want any retrieval to continue after the client
	has aborted, set both 'quick_abort_min' and 'quick_abort_max'
	to '0 KB'.

	If you want retrievals to always continue if they are being
	cached then set 'quick_abort_min' to '-1 KB'.

	Sets a upper limit on how far into the the file a Range request
	may be to cause Squid to prefetch the whole file. If beyond this

	is NOT cached.

	This is to stop a far ahead range request (lets say start at 17MB)
	from making Squid fetch the whole object up to that point before
	sending anything to the client.

	A value of -1 causes Squid to always fetch the object from the
	beginning so that it may cache the result. (2.0 style)

DOC_START
	The maximum amount of time that a client (browser) is allowed to
	remain connected to the cache process.  This protects the Cache
	from having a lot of sockets (and hence file descriptors) tied up
	in a CLOSE_WAIT state from remote clients that go away without
	properly shutting down (either because of a network failure or
	because of a poor client implementation).  The default is one
	day, 1440 minutes.

	NOTE:  The default value is intended to be much larger than any
	client would ever need to be connected to your cache.  You
	should probably change client_lifetime only as a last resort.
	If you seem to have many client connections tying up

        This option specifies the maximum size of a reply body.  It

	the reply_body_max_size lines are processed, and the first line with
	a result of "allow" is used as the maximum body size for this reply.
	This size is then checked twice. First when we get the reply headers,
	we check the content-length value.  If the content length value exists
	and is larger than the allowed size, the request is denied and the
	user receives an error message that says "the request or reply
	is too large." If there is no content-length, and the reply
	size exceeds this limit, the client's connection is just closed
	and they will receive a partial reply.

	WARNING: downstream caches probably can not detect a partial reply
	if there is no content-length header, so they will cache
	partial responses and give them out as hits.  You should NOT
	use this option if you have downstream caches.

	WARNING: A maximum size larger than the size of squid's error messages
	will cause an infinite loop and crash squid. Ensure that the smallest
	non-zero value you use is greater that the maximum header size plus
	the size of your largest error page.

	If you set this parameter to zero (the default), there will be

	If you are running Squid as a accelerator and have a single backend
	server then set this to on. This causes Squid to forward the request
	to this server irregardles of what any redirectors or Host headers
	says.

	Leave this at off if you have multiple backend servers, and use a
	redirector (or host table or private DNS) to map the requests to the
	appropriate backend servers. Note that the mapping needs to be a
	1-1 mapping between requested and backend (from redirector) domain
	names or caching will fail, as cacing is performed using the
	URL returned from the redirector.

DOC_START
	HTTP/1.1 requests include a Host: header which is basically the
	hostname from the URL.  Squid can be an accelerator for
	different HTTP servers by looking at this header.  However,
	Squid does NOT check the value of the Host header, so it opens
	a big security hole.  We recommend that this option remain
	disabled unless you are sure of what you are doing.

	However, you will need to enable this option if you run Squid
	as a transparent proxy.  Otherwise, virtual servers which
	require the Host: header will not be properly cached.

DOC_START
	Specifies the number of logfile rotations to make when you

	disable the rotation, but the logfiles are still closed and
	re-opened.  This will enable you to rename the logfiles
	yourself just before sending the rotate signal.

	Note, the 'squid -k rotate' command normally sends a USR1
	signal to the running squid process.  In certain situations
	(e.g. on Linux with Async I/O), USR1 is used for other
	purposes, so -k rotate uses another signal.  It is best to get

DOC_START
	Used only with memory_pools on:

	If set to a non-zero value, Squid will keep at most the specified
	limit of allocated (but unused) memory in memory pools. All free()
	requests that exceed this limit will be handled by your malloc
	library. Squid does not pre-allocate any memory, just safe-keeps
	objects that otherwise would be free()d. Thus, it is safe to set
	memory_pools_limit to a reasonably high value even if your
	configuration will use less memory.

	If not set (default) or set to zero, Squid will keep all memory it
	can. That is, there will be no limit on the total amount of memory
	used for safe-keeping.

	To disable memory allocation optimization, do not set
	memory_pools_limit to 0. Set memory_pools to "off" instead.

	An overhead for maintaining memory pools is not taken into account
	when the limit is checked. This overhead is close to four bytes per

	Usage: always_direct allow|deny [!]aclname ...

	Here you can use ACL elements to specify requests which should
	ALWAYS be forwarded directly to origin servers.  For example,
	to always directly forward requests for local servers use
	something like:

		acl local-servers dstdomain my.domain.net
		always_direct allow local-servers

	To always forward FTP requests directly, use

		acl FTP proto FTP
		always_direct allow FTP

	NOTE: There is a similar, but opposite option named
	'never_direct'.  You need to be aware that "always_direct deny
	foo" is NOT the same thing as "never_direct allow foo".  You
	may need to use a deny rule to exclude a more-specific case of
	some other rule.  Example:

		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
		acl local-servers dstdomain  .foo.net
		always_direct deny local-external
		always_direct allow local-servers

	Usage: never_direct allow|deny [!]aclname ...

	never_direct is the opposite of always_direct.  Please read
	the description for always_direct if you have not already.

	With 'never_direct' you can use ACL elements to specify
	requests which should NEVER be forwarded directly to origin
	servers.  For example, to force the use of a proxy for all
	requests, except those in your local domain use something like:

		acl local-servers dstdomain .foo.net
		acl all src 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
		never_direct deny local-servers
		never_direct allow all
	
	or if squid is inside a firewall and there is local intranet
	servers inside the firewall then use something like:

		acl local-intranet dstdomain .foo.net
		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
		always_direct deny local-external
		always_direct allow local-intranet

NAME: header_access

DOC_START
	Usage: header_access header_name allow|deny [!]aclname ...

	This option replaces the old 'anonymize_headers' and the
	older 'http_anonymizer' option with something that is much
	more configurable. This new method creates a list of ACLs
	for each header, allowing you very fine-tuned header
	mangling.

	You can only specify known headers for the header name.
	Other headers are reclassified as 'Other'. You can also
	refer to all the headers with 'All'.

	For example, to achieve the same behaviour as the old
	'http_anonymizer standard' option, you should use:

		header_access From deny all
		header_access Referer deny all
		header_access Server deny all
		header_access User-Agent deny all
		header_access WWW-Authenticate deny all
		header_access Link deny all

	Or, to reproduce the old 'http_anonymizer paranoid' feature
	you should use:

		header_access Allow allow all
		header_access Authorization allow all
		header_access Cache-Control allow all
		header_access Content-Encoding allow all
		header_access Content-Length allow all
		header_access Content-Type allow all
		header_access Date allow all
		header_access Expires allow all
		header_access Host allow all
		header_access If-Modified-Since allow all

		header_access Mime-Version allow all
		header_access Retry-After allow all
		header_access Title allow all
		header_access Connection allow all

	When a connection to a host is initiated, and that host has
	several IP addresses, the default connection timeout is reduced
	by dividing it by the number of addresses.  So, a site with 15
	addresses would then have a timeout of 8 seconds for each
	address attempted.  To avoid having the timeout reduced to the
	point where even a working host would not have a chance to
	respond, this setting is provided.  The default, and the

	the number of bytes (not bits - modem and network speeds are usually
	quoted in bits) per second placed into the bucket, and maximum is the
	maximum number of bytes which can be in the bucket at any time.

	For example, if delay pool number 1 is a class 2 delay pool as in the
	above example, and is being used to strictly limit each host to 64kbps
	(plus overheads), with no overall limit, the line is:

delay_parameters 1 -1/-1 8000/8000

	Note that the figure -1 is used to represent "unlimited".

	And, if delay pool number 2 is a class 3 delay pool as in the above
	example, and you want to limit it to a total of 256kbps (strict limit)
	with each 8-bit network permitted 64kbps (strict limit) and each
	individual host permitted 4800bps with a bucket maximum size of 64kb
	to permit a decent web page to be downloaded at a decent speed
	(if the network is not being limited due to overuse) but slow down
	large downloads more significantly:

delay_parameters 2 32000/32000 8000/8000 600/64000

	There must be one delay_parameters line for each delay pool.

	Quote from RFC 2068 section 4.1 on this matter:

	  Note: certain buggy HTTP/1.0 client implementations generate an
	  extra CRLF's after a POST request. To restate what is explicitly
	  forbidden by the BNF, an HTTP/1.1 client must not preface or follow
	  a request with an extra CRLF.

	to origin servers.

	If you set this to off, then Squid will prefer to send these
	requests to parents.

	Note that in most configurations, by turning this off you will only

NAME: ie_refresh
COMMENT: on|off
TYPE: onoff
LOC: Config.onoff.ie_refresh
DEFAULT: off
DOC_START
	Microsoft Internet Explorer up until version 5.5 Service
	Pack 1 has an issue with transparent proxies, wherein it
	is impossible to force a refresh.  Turning this on provides
	a partial fix to the problem, by causing all IMS-REFRESH
	requests from older IE versions to check the origin server
	for fresh content.  This reduces hit ratio by some amount
	(~10% in my experience), but allows users to actually get
	fresh content when they want it.  Note that because Squid
	cannot tell if the user is using 5.5 or 5.5SP1, the behavior
	of 5.5 is unchanged from old versions of Squid (i.e. a
	forced refresh is impossible).  Newer versions of IE will,
	hopefully, continue to have the new behavior and will be
	handled based on that assumption.  This option defaults to
	the old Squid behavior, which is better for hit ratios but
	worse for clients using IE, if they need to be able to
	force fresh content.

	processes, then these sleep delays will add up and your
	Squid will not service requests for some amount of time
