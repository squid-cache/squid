	WELCOME TO @SQUID@
	----------------------------

	This is the default Squid configuration file. You may wish
	to look at the Squid home page (http://www.squid-cache.org/)
	for the FAQ and other documentation.

	The default Squid config file shows what the defaults for
	various options happen to be.  If you don't need to change the
	default, you shouldn't uncomment the line.  Doing so may cause
	run-time problems.  In some cases "none" refers to no default
	setting at all, while in other cases it refers to a valid
	option - the comments for that keyword indicate if this is the
	case.

COMMENT_END

COMMENT_START
  Configuration options can be included using the "include" directive.
  Include takes a list of files to include. Quoting and wildcards is
  supported.

  For example,

  include /path/to/included/file/squid.acl.config

  Includes can be nested up to a hard-coded depth of 16 levels.
  This arbitrary restriction is to prevent recursive include references
  from causing Squid entering an infinite loop whilst trying to load
  configuration files.

 OPTIONS FOR AUTHENTICATION
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENT_END

NAME: auth_param
TYPE: authparam
LOC: Config.authConfiguration
DEFAULT: none
DOC_START
	This is used to define parameters for the various authentication
	schemes supported by Squid.

	format: auth_param scheme parameter [setting]

	The order in which authentication schemes are presented to the client is
	dependent on the order the scheme first appears in config file. IE
	has a bug (it's not RFC 2617 compliant) in that it will use the basic
	scheme if basic is the first entry presented, even if more secure
	schemes are presented. For now use the order in the recommended
	settings section below. If other browsers have difficulties (don't
	recognize the schemes offered even if you are using basic) either
	put basic first, or disable the other schemes (by commenting out their
	program entry).

	Once an authentication scheme is fully configured, it can only be
	shutdown by shutting squid down and restarting. Changes can be made on
	the fly and activated with a reconfigure. I.E. You can change to a
	different helper, but not unconfigure the helper completely.

	Please note that while this directive defines how Squid processes
	authentication it does not automatically activate authentication.
	To use authentication you must in addition make use of ACLs based
	on login name in http_access (proxy_auth, proxy_auth_regex or
	external with %LOGIN used in the format tag). The browser will be
	challenged for authentication on the first such acl encountered
	in http_access processing and will also be re-challenged for new
	login credentials if the request is being denied by a proxy_auth
	type acl.

	WARNING: authentication can't be used in a transparently intercepting
	proxy as the client then thinks it is talking to an origin server and
	not the proxy. This is a limitation of bending the TCP/IP protocol to
	transparently intercepting port 80, not a limitation in Squid.
	Ports flagged 'transparent', 'intercept', or 'tproxy' have
	authentication disabled.

	=== Parameters for the basic scheme follow. ===

	"program" cmdline
	Specify the command for the external authenticator.  Such a program
	reads a line containing "username password" and replies "OK" or
	"ERR" in an endless loop. "ERR" responses may optionally be followed
	by a error description available as %m in the returned error page.
	If you use an authenticator, make sure you have 1 acl of type
	proxy_auth.

	By default, the basic authentication scheme is not used unless a
	program is specified.

	If you want to use the traditional NCSA proxy authentication, set
	this line to something like

	auth_param basic program @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/libexec/ncsa_auth @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/etc/passwd

	"utf8" on|off
	HTTP uses iso-latin-1 as characterset, while some authentication
	backends such as LDAP expects UTF-8. If this is set to on Squid will
	translate the HTTP iso-latin-1 charset to UTF-8 before sending the
	username & password to the helper.

	"children" numberofchildren
	The number of authenticator processes to spawn. If you start too few
	Squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog of credential
	verifications, slowing it down. When password verifications are
	done via a (slow) network you are likely to need lots of
	authenticator processes.
	auth_param basic children 5

	"concurrency" concurrency
	The number of concurrent requests the helper can process.
	The default of 0 is used for helpers who only supports
	one request at a time. Setting this changes the protocol used to
	include a channel number first on the request/response line, allowing
	multiple requests to be sent to the same helper in parallell without
	wating for the response.
	Must not be set unless it's known the helper supports this.
	auth_param basic concurrency 0

	"realm" realmstring
	Specifies the realm name which is to be reported to the
	client for the basic proxy authentication scheme (part of
	the text the user will see when prompted their username and
	password). There is no default.
	auth_param basic realm Squid proxy-caching web server

	"credentialsttl" timetolive
	Specifies how long squid assumes an externally validated
	username:password pair is valid for - in other words how
	often the helper program is called for that user. Set this
	low to force revalidation with short lived passwords.  Note
	setting this high does not impact your susceptibility
	to replay attacks unless you are using an one-time password
	system (such as SecureID).  If you are using such a system,
	you will be vulnerable to replay attacks unless you also
	use the max_user_ip ACL in an http_access rule.

	"casesensitive" on|off
	Specifies if usernames are case sensitive. Most user databases are
	case insensitive allowing the same username to be spelled using both
	lower and upper case letters, but some are case sensitive. This
	makes a big difference for user_max_ip ACL processing and similar.
	auth_param basic casesensitive off

	=== Parameters for the digest scheme follow ===

	"program" cmdline
	Specify the command for the external authenticator.  Such
	a program reads a line containing "username":"realm" and
	replies with the appropriate H(A1) value hex encoded or
	ERR if the user (or his H(A1) hash) does not exists.
	See rfc 2616 for the definition of H(A1).
	"ERR" responses may optionally be followed by a error description
	available as %m in the returned error page.

	By default, the digest authentication scheme is not used unless a
	program is specified.

	If you want to use a digest authenticator, set this line to
	something like

	auth_param digest program @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/bin/digest_pw_auth @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/etc/digpass

	"utf8" on|off
	HTTP uses iso-latin-1 as characterset, while some authentication
	backends such as LDAP expects UTF-8. If this is set to on Squid will
	translate the HTTP iso-latin-1 charset to UTF-8 before sending the
	username & password to the helper.

	"children" numberofchildren
	The number of authenticator processes to spawn (no default).
	If you start too few Squid will have to wait for them to
	process a backlog of H(A1) calculations, slowing it down.
	When the H(A1) calculations are done via a (slow) network
	you are likely to need lots of authenticator processes.
	auth_param digest children 5

	"realm" realmstring
	Specifies the realm name which is to be reported to the
	client for the digest proxy authentication scheme (part of
	the text the user will see when prompted their username and
	password). There is no default.
	auth_param digest realm Squid proxy-caching web server

	"nonce_garbage_interval" timeinterval
	Specifies the interval that nonces that have been issued
	to client_agent's are checked for validity.

	"nonce_max_duration" timeinterval
	Specifies the maximum length of time a given nonce will be
	valid for.

	"nonce_max_count" number
	Specifies the maximum number of times a given nonce can be
	used.

	"nonce_strictness" on|off
	Determines if squid requires strict increment-by-1 behavior
	for nonce counts, or just incrementing (off - for use when
	useragents generate nonce counts that occasionally miss 1
	(ie, 1,2,4,6)). Default off.

	"check_nonce_count" on|off
	This directive if set to off can disable the nonce count check
	completely to work around buggy digest qop implementations in
	certain mainstream browser versions. Default on to check the
	nonce count to protect from authentication replay attacks.

	"post_workaround" on|off
	This is a workaround to certain buggy browsers who sends
	an incorrect request digest in POST requests when reusing
	the same nonce as acquired earlier on a GET request.

	=== NTLM scheme options follow ===

	"program" cmdline
	Specify the command for the external NTLM authenticator.
	Such a program reads exchanged NTLMSSP packets with
	the browser via Squid until authentication is completed.
	If you use an NTLM authenticator, make sure you have 1 acl
	of type proxy_auth.  By default, the NTLM authenticator_program
	is not used.

	auth_param ntlm program @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/bin/ntlm_auth

	"children" numberofchildren
	The number of authenticator processes to spawn (no default).
	If you start too few Squid will have to wait for them to
	process a backlog of credential verifications, slowing it
	down. When credential verifications are done via a (slow)
	network you are likely to need lots of authenticator
	processes.

	auth_param ntlm children 5

	"keep_alive" on|off
	Whether to keep the connection open after the initial response where
	Squid tells the browser which schemes are supported by the proxy.
	Some browsers are known to present many login popups or to corrupt
	POST/PUT requests transfer if the connection is not closed.
	The default is currently OFF to avoid this, but may change.
	
	auth_param ntlm keep_alive on

	=== Options for configuring the NEGOTIATE auth-scheme follow ===

	"program" cmdline
	Specify the command for the external Negotiate authenticator.
	This protocol is used in Microsoft Active-Directory enabled setups with
	the Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox browsers.
	Its main purpose is to exchange credentials with the Squid proxy
	using the Kerberos mechanisms.
	If you use a Negotiate authenticator, make sure you have at least
	one acl of type proxy_auth active. By default, the negotiate
	authenticator_program is not used.
	The only supported program for this role is the ntlm_auth
	program distributed as part of Samba, version 4 or later.

	auth_param negotiate program @DEFAULT_PREFIX@/bin/ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=gss-spnego

	"children" numberofchildren
	The number of authenticator processes to spawn (no default).
	If you start too few Squid will have to wait for them to
	process a backlog of credential verifications, slowing it
	down. When crendential verifications are done via a (slow)
	network you are likely to need lots of authenticator
	processes.
	auth_param negotiate children 5

	"keep_alive" on|off
	Whether to keep the connection open after the initial response where
	Squid tells the browser which schemes are supported by the proxy.
	Some browsers are known to present many login popups or to corrupt
	POST/PUT requests transfer if the connection is not closed.
	The default is currently OFF to avoid this, but may change.
	
	auth_param negotiate keep_alive on

NAME: authenticate_cache_garbage_interval
TYPE: time_t
DEFAULT: 1 hour
LOC: Config.authenticateGCInterval
DOC_START
	The time period between garbage collection across the username cache.
	This is a tradeoff between memory utilization (long intervals - say
	2 days) and CPU (short intervals - say 1 minute). Only change if you
	have good reason to.
DOC_END

NAME: authenticate_ttl
TYPE: time_t
DEFAULT: 1 hour
LOC: Config.authenticateTTL
DOC_START
	The time a user & their credentials stay in the logged in
	user cache since their last request. When the garbage
	interval passes, all user credentials that have passed their
	TTL are removed from memory.
DOC_END

NAME: authenticate_ip_ttl
TYPE: time_t
LOC: Config.authenticateIpTTL
DEFAULT: 0 seconds
DOC_START
	If you use proxy authentication and the 'max_user_ip' ACL,
	this directive controls how long Squid remembers the IP
	addresses associated with each user.  Use a small value
	(e.g., 60 seconds) if your users might change addresses
	quickly, as is the case with dialups.   You might be safe
	using a larger value (e.g., 2 hours) in a corporate LAN
	environment with relatively static address assignments.

DEFAULT: none
DOC_START
	This option defines external acl classes using a helper program
	to look up the status

	  external_acl_type name [options] FORMAT.. /path/to/helper [helper arguments..]

	Options:

	  ttl=n		TTL in seconds for cached results (defaults to 3600
	  		for 1 hour)
	  negative_ttl=n
	  		TTL for cached negative lookups (default same
	  		as ttl)
	  children=n	Number of acl helper processes spawn to service
			external acl lookups of this type. (default 5)
	  concurrency=n	concurrency level per process. Only used with helpers
			capable of processing more than one query at a time.
	  cache=n	result cache size, 0 is unbounded (default)
	  grace=n	Percentage remaining of TTL where a refresh of a
			cached entry should be initiated without needing to
			wait for a new reply. (default 0 for no grace period)
	  protocol=2.5	Compatibility mode for Squid-2.5 external acl helpers
	  ipv4 / ipv6	IP-mode used to communicate to this helper.
			For compatability with older configurations and helpers
			the default is currently 'ipv4'.

	FORMAT specifications

	  %LOGIN	Authenticated user login name
	  %EXT_USER	Username from external acl
	  %IDENT	Ident user name
	  %SRC		Client IP
	  %SRCPORT	Client source port
	  %URI		Requested URI
	  %DST		Requested host
	  %PROTO	Requested protocol
	  %PORT		Requested port
	  %PATH		Requested URL path
	  %METHOD	Request method
	  %MYADDR	Squid interface address
	  %MYPORT	Squid http_port number
	  %PATH		Requested URL-path (including query-string if any)
	  %USER_CERT	SSL User certificate in PEM format
	  %USER_CERTCHAIN SSL User certificate chain in PEM format
	  %USER_CERT_xx	SSL User certificate subject attribute xx
	  %USER_CA_xx	SSL User certificate issuer attribute xx

	  %>{Header}	HTTP request header "Header"
	  %>{Hdr:member}
	  		HTTP request header "Hdr" list member "member"
	  %>{Hdr:;member}
	  		HTTP request header list member using ; as
	  		list separator. ; can be any non-alphanumeric
			character.

	  %<{Header}	HTTP reply header "Header"
	  %<{Hdr:member}
	  		HTTP reply header "Hdr" list member "member"
	  %<{Hdr:;member}
	  		HTTP reply header list member using ; as
	  		list separator. ; can be any non-alphanumeric
			character.

	In addition to the above, any string specified in the referencing
	acl will also be included in the helper request line, after the
	specified formats (see the "acl external" directive)

	The helper receives lines per the above format specification,
	and returns lines starting with OK or ERR indicating the validity
	of the request and optionally followed by additional keywords with
	more details.

	General result syntax:

	  OK/ERR keyword=value ...

	Defined keywords:

	  user=		The users name (login)
	  password=	The users password (for login= cache_peer option)
	  message=	Message describing the reason. Available as %o
	  		in error pages
	  tag=		Apply a tag to a request (for both ERR and OK results)
	  		Only sets a tag, does not alter existing tags.
	  log=		String to be logged in access.log. Available as
	  		%ea in logformat specifications

	If protocol=3.0 (the default) then URL escaping is used to protect
	each value in both requests and responses.

	If using protocol=2.5 then all values need to be enclosed in quotes
	if they may contain whitespace, or the whitespace escaped using \.
	And quotes or \ characters within the keyword value must be \ escaped.

	When using the concurrency= option the protocol is changed by
	introducing a query channel tag infront of the request/response.
	The query channel tag is a number between 0 and concurrency-1.

LOC: Config.accessList.followXFF
DEFAULT_IF_NONE: deny all
DOC_START
	Allowing or Denying the X-Forwarded-For header to be followed to
	find the original source of a request.

	Requests may pass through a chain of several other proxies
	before reaching us.  The X-Forwarded-For header will contain a
	comma-separated list of the IP addresses in the chain, with the
	rightmost address being the most recent.

	If a request reaches us from a source that is allowed by this
	configuration item, then we consult the X-Forwarded-For header
	to see where that host received the request from.  If the
	X-Forwarded-For header contains multiple addresses, we continue
	backtracking until we reach an address for which we are not allowed
	to follow the X-Forwarded-For header, or until we reach the first
	address in the list. For the purpose of ACL used in the
	follow_x_forwarded_for directive the src ACL type always matches
	the address we are testing and srcdomain matches its rDNS.

	The end result of this process is an IP address that we will
	refer to as the indirect client address.  This address may
	be treated as the client address for access control, ICAP, delay
	pools and logging, depending on the acl_uses_indirect_client,
	icap_uses_indirect_client, delay_pool_uses_indirect_client and
	log_uses_indirect_client options.

	This clause only supports fast acl types.
	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.

	SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:

		Any host for which we follow the X-Forwarded-For header
		can place incorrect information in the header, and Squid
		will use the incorrect information as if it were the
		source address of the request.  This may enable remote
		hosts to bypass any access control restrictions that are
		based on the client's source addresses.

	For example:

		acl localhost src 127.0.0.1
		acl my_other_proxy srcdomain .proxy.example.com
		follow_x_forwarded_for allow localhost
		follow_x_forwarded_for allow my_other_proxy

	for this reply.

	This size is checked twice. First when we get the reply headers,
	we check the content-length value.  If the content length value exists
	and is larger than the allowed size, the request is denied and the
	user receives an error message that says "the request or reply
	is too large." If there is no content-length, and the reply
	size exceeds this limit, the client's connection is just closed
	and they will receive a partial reply.

	WARNING: downstream caches probably can not detect a partial reply
	if there is no content-length header, so they will cache
	partial responses and give them out as hits.  You should NOT
	use this option if you have downstream caches.

	WARNING: A maximum size smaller than the size of squid's error messages
	will cause an infinite loop and crash squid. Ensure that the smallest
	non-zero value you use is greater that the maximum header size plus
	the size of your largest error page.

	If you set this parameter none (the default), there will be

DEFAULT: none
LOC: Config.Sockaddr.http
DOC_START
	Usage:	port [options]
		hostname:port [options]
		1.2.3.4:port [options]

	The socket addresses where Squid will listen for HTTP client
	requests.  You may specify multiple socket addresses.
	There are three forms: port alone, hostname with port, and
	IP address with port.  If you specify a hostname or IP
	address, Squid binds the socket to that specific
	address.  This replaces the old 'tcp_incoming_address'
	option.  Most likely, you do not need to bind to a specific
	address, so you can use the port number alone.

	If you are running Squid in accelerator mode, you
	probably want to listen on port 80 also, or instead.

	The -a command line option may be used to specify additional
	port(s) where Squid listens for proxy request. Such ports will
	be plain proxy ports with no options.

	You may specify multiple socket addresses on multiple lines.

	Options:

	   intercept	Support for IP-Layer interception of
			outgoing requests without browser settings.
			NP: disables authentication and IPv6 on the port.

	   tproxy	Support Linux TPROXY for spoofing outgoing
			connections using the client IP address.
			NP: disables authentication and maybe IPv6 on the port.

	   accel	Accelerator mode. Also needs at least one of
			vhost / vport / defaultsite.

	   allow-direct	Allow direct forwarding in accelerator mode. Normally
			accelerated requests are denied direct forwarding as if
			never_direct was used.

	   defaultsite=domainname
			What to use for the Host: header if it is not present
			in a request. Determines what site (not origin server)
			accelerators should consider the default.
			Implies accel.

	   vhost	Accelerator mode using Host header for virtual
			domain support. Implies accel.

	   vport	Accelerator with IP based virtual host support.
			Implies accel.

	   vport=NN	As above, but uses specified port number rather
			than the http_port number. Implies accel.

	   protocol=	Protocol to reconstruct accelerated requests with.
			Defaults to http.

	   ignore-cc	Ignore request Cache-Control headers.

	   		Warning: This option violates HTTP specifications if
			used in non-accelerator setups.

	   connection-auth[=on|off]
	                use connection-auth=off to tell Squid to prevent 
	                forwarding Microsoft connection oriented authentication
			(NTLM, Negotiate and Kerberos)

	   disable-pmtu-discovery=
			Control Path-MTU discovery usage:
			    off		lets OS decide on what to do (default).
			    transparent	disable PMTU discovery when transparent
					support is enabled.
			    always	disable always PMTU discovery.

			In many setups of transparently intercepting proxies
			Path-MTU discovery can not work on traffic towards the
			clients. This is the case when the intercepting device
			does not fully track connections and fails to forward
			ICMP must fragment messages to the cache server. If you
			have such setup and experience that certain clients
			sporadically hang or never complete requests set
			disable-pmtu-discovery option to 'transparent'.

	   ssl-bump 	Intercept each CONNECT request matching ssl_bump ACL,
			establish secure connection with the client and with
			the server, decrypt HTTP messages as they pass through
			Squid, and treat them as unencrypted HTTP messages,
			becoming the man-in-the-middle.

			When this option is enabled, additional options become
			available to specify SSL-related properties of the
			client-side connection: cert, key, version, cipher,
			options, clientca, cafile, capath, crlfile, dhparams,
			sslflags, and sslcontext. See the https_port directive
			for more information on these options.

			The ssl_bump option is required to fully enable
			the SslBump feature.

	   name=	Specifies a internal name for the port. Defaults to
			the port specification (port or addr:port)

	   tcpkeepalive[=idle,interval,timeout]
			Enable TCP keepalive probes of idle connections.
			In seconds; idle is the initial time before TCP starts
			probing the connection, interval how often to probe, and
			timeout the time before giving up.

	If you run Squid on a dual-homed machine with an internal
	and an external interface we recommend you to specify the
	internal address:port in http_port. This way Squid will only be
	visible on the internal address.

				immediately, but wait until acl processing
				requires a certificate (not yet implemented).
			    NO_DEFAULT_CA
				Don't use the default CA lists built in

        IPv6 Magic:

	Squid is built with a capability of bridging the IPv4 and IPv6 
	internets.
	tcp_outgoing_address as exampled above breaks this bridging by forcing
	all outbound traffic through a certain IPv4 which may be on the wrong
	side of the IPv4/IPv6 boundary.

	To operate with tcp_outgoing_address and keep the bridging benefits
	an additional ACL needs to be used which ensures the IPv6-bound traffic
	is never forced or permitted out the IPv4 interface.

	acl to_ipv6 dst ipv6
	tcp_outgoing_address 2002::c001 good_service_net to_ipv6
	tcp_outgoing_address 10.1.0.2 good_service_net !to_ipv6

	tcp_outgoing_address 2002::beef normal_service_net to_ipv6
	tcp_outgoing_address 10.1.0.1 normal_service_net !to_ipv6

	tcp_outgoing_address 2002::1 to_ipv6
	tcp_outgoing_address 10.1.0.3 !to_ipv6

	WARNING:
	  'dst ipv6' bases its selection assuming DIRECT access.
	  If peers are used the peername ACL are needed to select outgoing
	  address which can link to the peer.

	  'dst ipv6' is a slow ACL. It will only work here if 'dst' is used
	  previously in the http_access rules to locate the destination IP.
	  Some more magic may be needed for that:
	    http_access allow to_ipv6 !all
	  (meaning, allow if to IPv6 but not from anywhere ;)

NAME: cache_peer
TYPE: peer
DEFAULT: none
LOC: Config.peers
DOC_START
	To specify other caches in a hierarchy, use the format:
	
		cache_peer hostname type http-port icp-port [options]
	
	For example,
	
	#                                        proxy  icp
	#          hostname             type     port   port  options
	#          -------------------- -------- ----- -----  -----------
	cache_peer parent.foo.net       parent    3128  3130  default
	cache_peer sib1.foo.net         sibling   3128  3130  proxy-only
	cache_peer sib2.foo.net         sibling   3128  3130  proxy-only
	cache_peer example.com          parent    80       0  no-query default
	cache_peer cdn.example.com      sibling   3128     0  
	
	      type:	either 'parent', 'sibling', or 'multicast'.
	
	proxy-port:	The port number where the peer accept HTTP requests.
			For other Squid proxies this is usually 3128
			For web servers this is usually 80
	
	  icp-port:	Used for querying neighbor caches about objects.
			Set to 0 if the peer does not support ICP or HTCP.
			See ICP and HTCP options below for additional details.
	
	
	==== ICP OPTIONS ====
	
	You MUST also set icp_port and icp_access explicitly when using these options.
	The defaults will prevent peer traffic using ICP.
	
	
	no-query	Disable ICP queries to this neighbor.
	
	multicast-responder
			Indicates the named peer is a member of a multicast group.
			ICP queries will not be sent directly to the peer, but ICP
			replies will be accepted from it.
	
	closest-only	Indicates that, for ICP_OP_MISS replies, we'll only forward
			CLOSEST_PARENT_MISSes and never FIRST_PARENT_MISSes.
	
	background-ping
			To only send ICP queries to this neighbor infrequently.
			This is used to keep the neighbor round trip time updated
			and is usually used in conjunction with weighted-round-robin.
	
	
	==== HTCP OPTIONS ====
	
	You MUST also set htcp_port and htcp_access explicitly when using these options.
	The defaults will prevent peer traffic using HTCP.
	
	
	htcp		Send HTCP, instead of ICP, queries to the neighbor.
			You probably also want to set the "icp-port" to 4827
			instead of 3130.
	
	htcp-oldsquid	Send HTCP to old Squid versions.
	
	htcp-no-clr	Send HTCP to the neighbor but without
			sending any CLR requests.  This cannot be used with
			htcp-only-clr.
	
	htcp-only-clr	Send HTCP to the neighbor but ONLY CLR requests.
			This cannot be used with htcp-no-clr.
	
	htcp-no-purge-clr
			Send HTCP to the neighbor including CLRs but only when
			they do not result from PURGE requests.
	
	htcp-forward-clr
			Forward any HTCP CLR requests this proxy receives to the peer.
	
	
	==== PEER SELECTION METHODS ====
	
	The default peer selection method is ICP, with the first responding peer
	being used as source. These options can be used for better load balancing.
	
	
	default		This is a parent cache which can be used as a "last-resort"
			if a peer cannot be located by any of the peer-selection methods.
			If specified more than once, only the first is used.
	
	round-robin	Load-Balance parents which should be used in a round-robin
			fashion in the absence of any ICP queries.
			weight=N can be used to add bias.
	
	weighted-round-robin
			Load-Balance parents which should be used in a round-robin
			fashion with the frequency of each parent being based on the
			round trip time. Closer parents are used more often.
			Usually used for background-ping parents.
			weight=N can be used to add bias.
	
	carp		Load-Balance parents which should be used as a CARP array.
			The requests will be distributed among the parents based on the
			CARP load balancing hash function based on their weight.
	
	userhash	Load-balance parents based on the client proxy_auth or ident username.
	
	sourcehash	Load-balance parents based on the client source IP.

	multicast-siblings
			To be used only for cache peers of type "multicast".
			ALL members of this multicast group have "sibling"
			relationship with it, not "parent".  This is to a mulicast
			group when the requested object would be fetched only from
			a "parent" cache, anyway.  It's useful, e.g., when
			configuring a pool of redundant Squid proxies, being
			members of the same multicast group.
	
	
	==== PEER SELECTION OPTIONS ====
	
	weight=N	use to affect the selection of a peer during any weighted
			peer-selection mechanisms.
			The weight must be an integer; default is 1,
			larger weights are favored more.
			This option does not affect parent selection if a peering
			protocol is not in use.
	
	basetime=N	Specify a base amount to be subtracted from round trip
			times of parents.
			It is subtracted before division by weight in calculating
			which parent to fectch from. If the rtt is less than the
			base time the rtt is set to a minimal value.
	
	ttl=N		Specify a TTL to use when sending multicast ICP queries
			to this address.
			Only useful when sending to a multicast group.
			Because we don't accept ICP replies from random
			hosts, you must configure other group members as
			peers with the 'multicast-responder' option.
	
	no-delay	To prevent access to this neighbor from influencing the
			delay pools.
	
	digest-url=URL	Tell Squid to fetch the cache digest (if digests are
			enabled) for this host from the specified URL rather
			than the Squid default location.
	
	
	==== ACCELERATOR / REVERSE-PROXY OPTIONS ====
	
	originserver	Causes this parent to be contacted as an origin server.
			Meant to be used in accelerator setups when the peer
			is a web server.
	
	forceddomain=name
			Set the Host header of requests forwarded to this peer.
			Useful in accelerator setups where the server (peer)
			expects a certain domain name but clients may request
			others. ie example.com or www.example.com
	
	no-digest	Disable request of cache digests.
	
	no-netdb-exchange
			Disables requesting ICMP RTT database (NetDB).
	
	
	==== AUTHENTICATION OPTIONS ====
	
	login=user:password
			If this is a personal/workgroup proxy and your parent
			requires proxy authentication.
			
			Note: The string can include URL escapes (i.e. %20 for
			spaces). This also means % must be written as %%.
	
	login=PROXYPASS
			Send login details received from client to this peer.
			Authentication is not required, nor changed.
			
			Note: This will pass any form of authentication but
			only Basic auth will work through a proxy unless the
			connection-auth options are also used.
	
	login=PASS	Send login details received from client to this peer.
			Authentication is not required by this option.
			If there are no client-provided authentication headers
			to pass on, but username and password are available
			from either proxy login or an external ACL user= and
			password= result tags they may be sent instead.
			
			Note: To combine this with proxy_auth both proxies must
			share the same user database as HTTP only allows for
			a single login (one for proxy, one for origin server).
			Also be warned this will expose your users proxy
			password to the peer. USE WITH CAUTION
	
	login=*:password
			Send the username to the upstream cache, but with a
			fixed password. This is meant to be used when the peer
			is in another administrative domain, but it is still
			needed to identify each user.
			The star can optionally be followed by some extra
			information which is added to the username. This can
			be used to identify this proxy to the peer, similar to
			the login=username:password option above.
	
	connection-auth=on|off
			Tell Squid that this peer does or not support Microsoft
			connection oriented authentication, and any such
			challenges received from there should be ignored.
			Default is auto to automatically determine the status
			of the peer.
	
	
	==== SSL / HTTPS / TLS OPTIONS ====
	
	ssl		Encrypt connections to this peer with SSL/TLS.
	
	sslcert=/path/to/ssl/certificate
			A client SSL certificate to use when connecting to
			this peer.
	
	sslkey=/path/to/ssl/key
			The private SSL key corresponding to sslcert above.
			If 'sslkey' is not specified 'sslcert' is assumed to
			reference a combined file containing both the
			certificate and the key.
	
	sslversion=1|2|3|4
			The SSL version to use when connecting to this peer
				1 = automatic (default)
				2 = SSL v2 only
				3 = SSL v3 only
				4 = TLS v1 only
	
	sslcipher=...	The list of valid SSL ciphers to use when connecting
			to this peer.
	
	ssloptions=... 	Specify various SSL engine options:
				NO_SSLv2  Disallow the use of SSLv2
				NO_SSLv3  Disallow the use of SSLv3
				NO_TLSv1  Disallow the use of TLSv1
			See src/ssl_support.c or the OpenSSL documentation for
			a more complete list.
	
	sslcafile=... 	A file containing additional CA certificates to use
			when verifying the peer certificate.
	
	sslcapath=...	A directory containing additional CA certificates to
			use when verifying the peer certificate.
	
	sslcrlfile=... 	A certificate revocation list file to use when
			verifying the peer certificate.
	
	sslflags=...	Specify various flags modifying the SSL implementation:
	
			DONT_VERIFY_PEER
				Accept certificates even if they fail to
				verify.
			NO_DEFAULT_CA
				Don't use the default CA list built in
				to OpenSSL.
			DONT_VERIFY_DOMAIN
				Don't verify the peer certificate
				matches the server name
	
	ssldomain= 	The peer name as advertised in it's certificate.
			Used for verifying the correctness of the received peer
			certificate. If not specified the peer hostname will be
			used.
	
	front-end-https
			Enable the "Front-End-Https: On" header needed when
			using Squid as a SSL frontend in front of Microsoft OWA.
			See MS KB document Q307347 for details on this header.
			If set to auto the header will only be added if the
			request is forwarded as a https:// URL.
	
	
	==== GENERAL OPTIONS ====
	
	connect-timeout=N
			A peer-specific connect timeout.
			Also see the peer_connect_timeout directive.
	
	connect-fail-limit=N
			How many times connecting to a peer must fail before
			it is marked as down. Default is 10.
	
	allow-miss	Disable Squid's use of only-if-cached when forwarding
			requests to siblings. This is primarily useful when
			icp_hit_stale is used by the sibling. To extensive use
			of this option may result in forwarding loops, and you
			should avoid having two-way peerings with this option.
			For example to deny peer usage on requests from peer
			by denying cache_peer_access if the source is a peer.
	
	max-conn=N	Limit the amount of connections Squid may open to this
			peer. see also 
	
	name=xxx	Unique name for the peer.
			Required if you have multiple peers on the same host
			but different ports.
			This name can be used in cache_peer_access and similar
			directives to dentify the peer.
			Can be used by outgoing access controls through the
			peername ACL type.
	
	no-tproxy	Do not use the client-spoof TPROXY support when forwarding
			requests to this peer. Use normal address selection instead.
	
	proxy-only	objects fetched from the peer will not be stored locally.

NAME: cache_peer_domain cache_host_domain
TYPE: hostdomain
DEFAULT: none
LOC: none
DOC_START
	Use to limit the domains for which a neighbor cache will be
	queried.  Usage:

	cache_peer_domain cache-host domain [domain ...]
	cache_peer_domain cache-host !domain

	For example, specifying

		cache_peer_domain parent.foo.net	.edu

	has the effect such that UDP query packets are sent to
	'bigserver' only when the requested object exists on a
	server in the .edu domain.  Prefixing the domainname
	with '!' means the cache will be queried for objects
	NOT in that domain.

	NOTE:	* Any number of domains may be given for a cache-host,
		  either on the same or separate lines.
		* When multiple domains are given for a particular
		  cache-host, the first matched domain is applied.
		* Cache hosts with no domain restrictions are queried

	Modifying the neighbor type for specific domains is now

	default neighbor type specified on the 'cache_peer' line.
	Normally it should only be necessary to list domains which
	should be treated differently because the default neighbor type
	applies for hostnames which do not match domains listed here.

EXAMPLE:
	cache_peer cache.foo.org parent 3128 3130

NAME: dead_peer_timeout
COMMENT: (seconds)
DEFAULT: 10 seconds
TYPE: time_t
LOC: Config.Timeout.deadPeer
DOC_START
	This controls how long Squid waits to declare a peer cache
	as "dead."  If there are no ICP replies received in this
	amount of time, Squid will declare the peer dead and not
	expect to receive any further ICP replies.  However, it
	continues to send ICP queries, and will mark the peer as
	alive upon receipt of the first subsequent ICP reply.

	This timeout also affects when Squid expects to receive ICP
	replies from peers.  If more than 'dead_peer' seconds have
	passed since the last ICP reply was received, Squid will not
	expect to receive an ICP reply on the next query.  Thus, if
	your time between requests is greater than this timeout, you
	will see a lot of requests sent DIRECT to origin servers
	instead of to your parents.
DOC_END

 MEMORY CACHE OPTIONS

COMMENT_END

NAME: cache_mem
COMMENT: (bytes)
TYPE: b_size_t
DEFAULT: 256 MB
LOC: Config.memMaxSize
DOC_START
	NOTE: THIS PARAMETER DOES NOT SPECIFY THE MAXIMUM PROCESS SIZE.
	IT ONLY PLACES A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL MEMORY SQUID WILL
	USE AS A MEMORY CACHE OF OBJECTS. SQUID USES MEMORY FOR OTHER
	THINGS AS WELL. SEE THE SQUID FAQ SECTION 8 FOR DETAILS.

	'cache_mem' specifies the ideal amount of memory to be used
	for:
		* In-Transit objects
		* Hot Objects
		* Negative-Cached objects

	Data for these objects are stored in 4 KB blocks.  This
	parameter specifies the ideal upper limit on the total size of
	4 KB blocks allocated.  In-Transit objects take the highest
	priority.

	In-transit objects have priority over the others.  When
	additional space is needed for incoming data, negative-cached
	and hot objects will be released.  In other words, the
	negative-cached and hot objects will fill up any unused space
	not needed for in-transit objects.

	If circumstances require, this limit will be exceeded.
	Specifically, if your incoming request rate requires more than
	'cache_mem' of memory to hold in-transit objects, Squid will
	exceed this limit to satisfy the new requests.  When the load
	decreases, blocks will be freed until the high-water mark is
	reached.  Thereafter, blocks will be used to store hot
	objects.
DOC_END

NAME: maximum_object_size_in_memory
COMMENT: (bytes)

LOC: Config.Store.maxInMemObjSize

 DISK CACHE OPTIONS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENT_END

NAME: cache_replacement_policy
TYPE: removalpolicy
LOC: Config.replPolicy
DEFAULT: lru
DOC_START
	The cache replacement policy parameter determines which
	objects are evicted (replaced) when disk space is needed.

	    lru       : Squid's original list based LRU policy
	    heap GDSF : Greedy-Dual Size Frequency
	    heap LFUDA: Least Frequently Used with Dynamic Aging
	    heap LRU  : LRU policy implemented using a heap

	Applies to any cache_dir lines listed below this.

	The LRU policies keeps recently referenced objects.

	The heap GDSF policy optimizes object hit rate by keeping smaller
	popular objects in cache so it has a better chance of getting a
	hit.  It achieves a lower byte hit rate than LFUDA though since
	it evicts larger (possibly popular) objects.

	The heap LFUDA policy keeps popular objects in cache regardless of
	their size and thus optimizes byte hit rate at the expense of
	hit rate since one large, popular object will prevent many
	smaller, slightly less popular objects from being cached.

	Both policies utilize a dynamic aging mechanism that prevents
	cache pollution that can otherwise occur with frequency-based
	replacement policies.

	NOTE: if using the LFUDA replacement policy you should increase
	the value of maximum_object_size above its default of 4096 KB to
	to maximize the potential byte hit rate improvement of LFUDA.

	For more information about the GDSF and LFUDA cache replacement
	policies see http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/1999/HPL-1999-69.html

	configuration.  Do NOT put the size of your disk drive here.
	Instead, if you want Squid to use the entire disk drive,
	subtract 20% and use that value.

	'L1' is the number of first-level subdirectories which
	will be created under the 'Directory'.  The default is 16.

	'L2' is the number of second-level subdirectories which
	will be created under each first-level directory.  The default
	is 256.

	The aufs store type:

	"aufs" uses the same storage format as "ufs", utilizing
	POSIX-threads to avoid blocking the main Squid process on
	disk-I/O. This was formerly known in Squid as async-io.

	cache_dir aufs Directory-Name Mbytes L1 L2 [options]

	see argument descriptions under ufs above

	The diskd store type:

	"diskd" uses the same storage format as "ufs", utilizing a
	separate process to avoid blocking the main Squid process on
	disk-I/O.

	cache_dir diskd Directory-Name Mbytes L1 L2 [options] [Q1=n] [Q2=n]

	see argument descriptions under ufs above

	Q1 specifies the number of unacknowledged I/O requests when Squid
	stops opening new files. If this many messages are in the queues,
	Squid won't open new files. Default is 64

	Q2 specifies the number of unacknowledged messages when Squid
	starts blocking.  If this many messages are in the queues,
	Squid blocks until it receives some replies. Default is 72

	When Q1 < Q2 (the default), the cache directory is optimized
	for lower response time at the expense of a decrease in hit
	ratio.  If Q1 > Q2, the cache directory is optimized for
	higher hit ratio at the expense of an increase in response
	time.

	The coss store type:

	NP: COSS filesystem in Squid-3 has been deemed too unstable for
	    production use and has thus been removed from this release.
	    We hope that it can be made usable again soon.

	block-size=n defines the "block size" for COSS cache_dir's.
	Squid uses file numbers as block numbers.  Since file numbers
	are limited to 24 bits, the block size determines the maximum
	size of the COSS partition.  The default is 512 bytes, which
	leads to a maximum cache_dir size of 512<<24, or 8 GB.  Note
	you should not change the coss block size after Squid
	has written some objects to the cache_dir.

	The coss file store has changed from 2.5. Now it uses a file
	called 'stripe' in the directory names in the config - and
	this will be created by squid -z.

	Common options:

	no-store, no new objects should be stored to this cache_dir

	max-size=n, refers to the max object size in bytes this cache_dir
	supports.  It is used to select the cache_dir to store the object.
	Note: To make optimal use of the max-size limits you should order
	the cache_dir lines with the smallest max-size value first and the
	ones with no max-size specification last.

	Note for coss, max-size must be less than COSS_MEMBUF_SZ,
	which can be changed with the --with-coss-membuf-size=N configure
	option.

DOC_START
	Usage:

	logformat <name> <format specification>

	Defines an access log format.

	The <format specification> is a string with embedded % format codes

	% format codes all follow the same basic structure where all but
	the formatcode is optional. Output strings are automatically escaped
	as required according to their context and the output format
	modifiers are usually not needed, but can be specified if an explicit
	output format is desired.

		% ["|[|'|#] [-] [[0]width] [{argument}] formatcode

		"	output in quoted string format
		[	output in squid text log format as used by log_mime_hdrs
		#	output in URL quoted format
		'	output as-is

		-	left aligned
		width	field width. If starting with 0 the
			output is zero padded
		{arg}	argument such as header name etc

	Format codes:

		%	a literal % character
		>a	Client source IP address
		>A	Client FQDN
		>p	Client source port
		<A	Server IP address or peer name
		la	Local IP address (http_port)
		lp	Local port number (http_port)
		ts	Seconds since epoch
		tu	subsecond time (milliseconds)
		tl	Local time. Optional strftime format argument
				default %d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z
		tg	GMT time. Optional strftime format argument
				default %d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z
		tr	Response time (milliseconds)
		dt	Total time spent making DNS lookups (milliseconds)

	HTTP cache related format codes:

		[http::]>h	Original request header. Optional header name argument
				on the format header[:[separator]element]
		[http::]>ha	The HTTP request headers after adaptation and redirection. 
				Optional header name argument as for >h
		[http::]<h	Reply header. Optional header name argument
				as for >h
		[http::]un	User name
		[http::]ul	User name from authentication
		[http::]ui	User name from ident
		[http::]us	User name from SSL
		[http::]ue	User name from external acl helper
		[http::]>Hs	HTTP status code sent to the client
		[http::]<Hs	HTTP status code received from the next hop
		[http::]Ss	Squid request status (TCP_MISS etc)
		[http::]Sh	Squid hierarchy status (DEFAULT_PARENT etc)
		[http::]mt	MIME content type
		[http::]rm	Request method (GET/POST etc)
		[http::]ru	Request URL
		[http::]rp	Request URL-Path excluding hostname
		[http::]rv	Request protocol version
		[http::]et	Tag returned by external acl
		[http::]ea	Log string returned by external acl
		[http::]<st	Sent reply size including HTTP headers
		[http::]>st	Received request size including HTTP headers. In the
				case of chunked requests the chunked encoding metadata
				are not included
		[http::]>sh	Received HTTP request headers size
		[http::]<sh	Sent HTTP reply headers size
		[http::]st	Request+Reply size including HTTP headers
		[http::]<sH	Reply high offset sent
		[http::]<sS	Upstream object size
		[http::]<pt	Peer response time in milliseconds. The timer starts
				when the last request byte is sent to the next hop
				and stops when the last response byte is received.
		[http::]<tt	Total server-side time in milliseconds. The timer 
				starts with the first connect request (or write I/O)
				sent to the first selected peer. The timer stops
				with the last I/O with the last peer.

	If ICAP is enabled, the following two codes become available (as
	well as ICAP log codes documented with the icap_log option):

		icap::tt        Total ICAP processing time for the HTTP
				transaction. The timer ticks when ICAP
				ACLs are checked and when ICAP
				transaction is in progress.

		icap::<last_h	The header of the last ICAP response
				related to the HTTP transaction. Like
				<h, accepts an optional header name
				argument.  Will not change semantics
				when multiple ICAP transactions per HTTP
				transaction are supported.

	If adaptation is enabled the following two codes become available:

		adapt::sum_trs Summed adaptation transaction response
				times recorded as a comma-separated list in
				the order of transaction start time. Each time
				value is recorded as an integer number,
				representing response time of one or more
				adaptation (ICAP or eCAP) transaction in
				milliseconds.  When a failed transaction is
				being retried or repeated, its time is not
				logged individually but added to the
				replacement (next) transaction. See also:
				adapt::all_trs.

		adapt::all_trs All adaptation transaction response times.
				Same as adaptation_strs but response times of
				individual transactions are never added
				together. Instead, all transaction response
				times are recorded individually.

	You can prefix adapt::*_trs format codes with adaptation
	service name in curly braces to record response time(s) specific
	to that service. For example: %{my_service}adapt::sum_trs

	The default formats available (which do not need re-defining) are:

logformat squid %ts.%03tu %6tr %>a %Ss/%03>Hs %<st %rm %ru %un %Sh/%<A %mt
logformat squidmime %ts.%03tu %6tr %>a %Ss/%03>Hs %<st %rm %ru %un %Sh/%<A %mt [%>h] [%<h]

	These files log client request activities. Has a line every HTTP or
	ICP request. The format is:
	access_log <filepath> [<logformat name> [acl acl ...]]
	access_log none [acl acl ...]]

	Will log to the specified file using the specified format (which
	must be defined in a logformat directive) those entries which match
	ALL the acl's specified (which must be defined in acl clauses).
	If no acl is specified, all requests will be logged to this file.

	To disable logging of a request use the filepath "none", in which case
	a logformat name should not be specified.

	To log the request via syslog specify a filepath of "syslog":

	access_log syslog[:facility.priority] [format [acl1 [acl2 ....]]]

NAME: icap_log
TYPE: access_log
IFDEF: ICAP_CLIENT
LOC: Config.Log.icaplogs

DOC_START
	ICAP log files record ICAP transaction summaries, one line per
	transaction.

	The icap_log option format is:
	icap_log <filepath> [<logformat name> [acl acl ...]]
	icap_log none [acl acl ...]]
	
	Please see access_log option documentation for details. The two
	kinds of logs share the overall configuration approach and many
	features.

	ICAP processing of a single HTTP message or transaction may
	require multiple ICAP transactions.  In such cases, multiple
	ICAP transaction log lines will correspond to a single access
	log line.

	ICAP log uses logformat codes that make sense for an ICAP
	transaction. Header-related codes are applied to the HTTP header
	embedded in an ICAP server response, with the following caveats:
	For REQMOD, there is no HTTP response header unless the ICAP
	server performed request satisfaction. For RESPMOD, the HTTP
	request header is the header sent to the ICAP server. For
	OPTIONS, there are no HTTP headers.

	The following format codes are also available for ICAP logs:

		icap::<A	ICAP server IP address. Similar to <A.

		icap::<service_name	ICAP service name from the icap_service
				option in Squid configuration file.

		icap::ru	ICAP Request-URI. Similar to ru.

		icap::rm	ICAP request method (REQMOD, RESPMOD, or 
				OPTIONS). Similar to existing rm.

		icap::>st	Bytes sent to the ICAP server (TCP payload
				only; i.e., what Squid writes to the socket).

		icap::<st	Bytes received from the ICAP server (TCP
				payload only; i.e., what Squid reads from
				the socket).

		icap::tr 	Transaction response time (in
				milliseconds).  The timer starts when
				the ICAP transaction is created and
				stops when the transaction is completed.
				Similar to tr.

		icap::tio	Transaction I/O time (in milliseconds). The
				timer starts when the first ICAP request
				byte is scheduled for sending. The timers
				stops when the last byte of the ICAP response
				is received.

		icap::to 	Transaction outcome: ICAP_ERR* for all
				transaction errors, ICAP_OPT for OPTION
				transactions, ICAP_ECHO for 204
				responses, ICAP_MOD for message
				modification, and ICAP_SAT for request
				satisfaction. Similar to Ss.

		icap::Hs	ICAP response status code. Similar to Hs.

		icap::>h	ICAP request header(s). Similar to >h.

		icap::<h	ICAP response header(s). Similar to <h.

	The default ICAP log format, which can be used without an explicit
	definition, is called icap_squid:

logformat icap_squid %ts.%03tu %6icap::tr %>a %icap::to/%03icap::Hs %icap::<size %icap::rm %icap::ru% %un -/%icap::<A -

NAME: cache_swap_state cache_swap_log
TYPE: string
LOC: Config.Log.swap
DEFAULT: none
DOC_START
	Location for the cache "swap.state" file. This index file holds
	the metadata of objects saved on disk.  It is used to rebuild
	the cache during startup.  Normally this file resides in each
	'cache_dir' directory, but you may specify an alternate
	pathname here.  Note you must give a full filename, not just
	a directory. Since this is the index for the whole object
	list you CANNOT periodically rotate it!

	If %s can be used in the file name it will be replaced with a
	a representation of the cache_dir name where each / is replaced
	with '.'. This is needed to allow adding/removing cache_dir
	lines when cache_swap_log is being used.

	If have more than one 'cache_dir', and %s is not used in the name
	these swap logs will have names such as:

		cache_swap_log.00
		cache_swap_log.01
		cache_swap_log.02

	The numbered extension (which is added automatically)
	corresponds to the order of the 'cache_dir' lines in this
	configuration file.  If you change the order of the 'cache_dir'
	lines in this file, these index files will NOT correspond to
	the correct 'cache_dir' entry (unless you manually rename
	them).  We recommend you do NOT use this option.  It is
	better to keep these index files in each 'cache_dir' directory.
DOC_END

NAME: logfile_rotate
TYPE: int
DEFAULT: 10
LOC: Config.Log.rotateNumber
DOC_START
	Specifies the number of logfile rotations to make when you
	type 'squid -k rotate'. The default is 10, which will rotate
	with extensions 0 through 9. Setting logfile_rotate to 0 will
	disable the file name rotation, but the logfiles are still closed
	and re-opened. This will enable you to rename the logfiles
	yourself just before sending the rotate signal.

	Note, the 'squid -k rotate' command normally sends a USR1
	signal to the running squid process.  In certain situations
	(e.g. on Linux with Async I/O), USR1 is used for other
	purposes, so -k rotate uses another signal.  It is best to get
	in the habit of using 'squid -k rotate' instead of 'kill -USR1
	<pid>'.

	Note, from Squid-3.1 this option has no effect on the cache.log,
	that log can be rotated separately by using debug_options

	'Min' is the time (in minutes) an object without an explicit
	expiry time should be considered fresh. The recommended
	value is 0, any higher values may cause dynamic applications
	to be erroneously cached unless the application designer
	has taken the appropriate actions.

	'Percent' is a percentage of the objects age (time since last
	modification age) an object without explicit expiry time
	will be considered fresh.

	'Max' is an upper limit on how long objects without an explicit
	expiry time will be considered fresh.

		 reload-into-ims
		 ignore-reload
		 ignore-no-cache

		VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling this feature
		could make you liable for problems which it causes.

		Note: override-expire does not enforce staleness - it only extends
		freshness / min. If the server returns a Expires time which
		is longer than your max time, Squid will still consider
		the object fresh for that period of time.

		override-lastmod enforces min age even on objects
		that were modified recently.

		reload-into-ims changes client no-cache or ``reload''
		to If-Modified-Since requests. Doing this VIOLATES the
		HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you
		liable for problems which it causes.

		ignore-reload ignores a client no-cache or ``reload''
		header. Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard. Enabling
		this feature could make you liable for problems which
		it causes.

		ignore-no-cache ignores any ``Pragma: no-cache'' and
		``Cache-control: no-cache'' headers received from a server.
		The HTTP RFC never allows the use of this (Pragma) header
		from a server, only a client, though plenty of servers
		send it anyway.

		ignore-no-store ignores any ``Cache-control: no-store''
		headers received from a server. Doing this VIOLATES
		the HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you

		ignore-private ignores any ``Cache-control: private''
		headers received from a server. Doing this VIOLATES
		the HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you
		liable for problems which it causes.

		ignore-auth caches responses to requests with authorization,
		as if the originserver had sent ``Cache-control: public''
		in the response header. Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.
		Enabling this feature could make you liable for problems which
		it causes.

		refresh-ims causes squid to contact the origin server
		when a client issues an If-Modified-Since request. This
		ensures that the client will receive an updated version
		if one is available.

	Basically a cached object is:

		FRESH if expires < now, else STALE
		STALE if age > max
		FRESH if lm-factor < percent, else STALE
		FRESH if age < min
		else STALE

	This is to stop a far ahead range request (lets say start at 17MB)
	from making Squid fetch the whole object up to that point before
	sending anything to the client.

	A value of 0 causes Squid to never fetch more than the
	client requested. (default)

	A value of -1 causes Squid to always fetch the object from the
	beginning so it may cache the result. (2.0 style)

	NP: Using -1 here will override any quick_abort settings that may

LOC: Config.maxChunkedRequestBodySize
DOC_START
	A broken or confused HTTP/1.1 client may send a chunked HTTP
	request to Squid. Squid does not have full support for that
	feature yet. To cope with such requests, Squid buffers the
	entire request and then dechunks request body to create a
	plain HTTP/1.0 request with a known content length. The plain
	request is then used by the rest of Squid code as usual.

	The option value specifies the maximum size of the buffer used
	to hold the request before the conversion. If the chunked
	request size exceeds the specified limit, the conversion
	fails, and the client receives an "unsupported request" error,
	as if dechunking was disabled.

	Dechunking is enabled by default. To disable conversion of
	chunked requests, set the maximum to zero.

	Request dechunking feature and this option in particular are a
	temporary hack. When chunking requests and responses are fully
	supported, there will be no need to buffer a chunked request.

	Quote from RFC2616 section 4.1 on this matter:

	  Note: certain buggy HTTP/1.0 client implementations generate an
	  extra CRLF's after a POST request. To restate what is explicitly

	Microsoft Internet Explorer up until version 5.5 Service

	a partial fix to the problem, by causing all IMS-REFRESH
	requests from older IE versions to check the origin server
	for fresh content.  This reduces hit ratio by some amount
	(~10% in my experience), but allows users to actually get
	fresh content when they want it.  Note because Squid
	cannot tell if the user is using 5.5 or 5.5SP1, the behavior
	of 5.5 is unchanged from old versions of Squid (i.e. a
	forced refresh is impossible).  Newer versions of IE will,
	hopefully, continue to have the new behavior and will be

	from having a lot of sockets (and hence file descriptors) tied up
	in a CLOSE_WAIT state from remote clients that go away without
	properly shutting down (either because of a network failure or
	because of a poor client implementation).  The default is one
	day, 1440 minutes.

	NOTE:  The default value is intended to be much larger than any
	client would ever need to be connected to your cache.  You
	should probably change client_lifetime only as a last resort.
	If you seem to have many client connections tying up

	read(2) returns "no more data to read."

	Change this option to 'on' and Squid will keep open connections

DOC_END

NAME: delay_class
TYPE: delay_pool_class
DEFAULT: none
IFDEF: DELAY_POOLS
LOC: Config.Delay
DOC_START
	This defines the class of each delay pool.  There must be exactly one
	delay_class line for each delay pool.  For example, to define two
	delay pools, one of class 2 and one of class 3, the settings above
	and here would be:

	Example:
	    delay_pools 4      # 4 delay pools
	    delay_class 1 2    # pool 1 is a class 2 pool
	    delay_class 2 3    # pool 2 is a class 3 pool
	    delay_class 3 4    # pool 3 is a class 4 pool
	    delay_class 4 5    # pool 4 is a class 5 pool

	The delay pool classes are:

		class 1		Everything is limited by a single aggregate
				bucket.

		class 2 	Everything is limited by a single aggregate
				bucket as well as an "individual" bucket chosen
				from bits 25 through 32 of the IPv4 address.

		class 3		Everything is limited by a single aggregate
				bucket as well as a "network" bucket chosen
				from bits 17 through 24 of the IP address and a
				"individual" bucket chosen from bits 17 through
				32 of the IPv4 address.

		class 4		Everything in a class 3 delay pool, with an
				additional limit on a per user basis. This
				only takes effect if the username is established
				in advance - by forcing authentication in your
				http_access rules.

		class 5		Requests are grouped according their tag (see
				external_acl's tag= reply).

	NOTE: If an IP address is a.b.c.d
		-> bits 25 through 32 are "d"
		-> bits 17 through 24 are "c"
		-> bits 17 through 32 are "c * 256 + d"

	NOTE-2: Due to the use of bitmasks in class 2,3,4 pools they only apply to
		IPv4 traffic. Class 1 and 5 pools may be used with IPv6 traffic.
DOC_END

NAME: delay_access
TYPE: delay_pool_access
DEFAULT: none
IFDEF: DELAY_POOLS
LOC: Config.Delay
DOC_START
	This is used to determine which delay pool a request falls into.

	delay_access is sorted per pool and the matching starts with pool 1,
	then pool 2, ..., and finally pool N. The first delay pool where the
	request is allowed is selected for the request. If it does not allow
	the request to any pool then the request is not delayed (default).

	For example, if you want some_big_clients in delay
	pool 1 and lotsa_little_clients in delay pool 2:

Example:
 delay_access 1 allow some_big_clients
 delay_access 1 deny all
 delay_access 2 allow lotsa_little_clients
 delay_access 2 deny all
 delay_access 3 allow authenticated_clients
DOC_END

NAME: delay_parameters
TYPE: delay_pool_rates
DEFAULT: none
IFDEF: DELAY_POOLS
LOC: Config.Delay
DOC_START
	This defines the parameters for a delay pool.  Each delay pool has
	a number of "buckets" associated with it, as explained in the
	description of delay_class.  For a class 1 delay pool, the syntax is:

delay_parameters pool aggregate

	For a class 2 delay pool:

delay_parameters pool aggregate individual

	For a class 3 delay pool:

delay_parameters pool aggregate network individual

	For a class 4 delay pool:

delay_parameters pool aggregate network individual user

	For a class 5 delay pool:

delay_parameters pool tag

	The variables here are:

		pool		a pool number - ie, a number between 1 and the
				number specified in delay_pools as used in
				delay_class lines.

		aggregate	the "delay parameters" for the aggregate bucket
				(class 1, 2, 3).

		individual	the "delay parameters" for the individual
				buckets (class 2, 3).

		network		the "delay parameters" for the network buckets
				(class 3).

		user		the delay parameters for the user buckets
				(class 4).

		tag		the delay parameters for the tag buckets
				(class 5).

	A pair of delay parameters is written restore/maximum, where restore is
	the number of bytes (not bits - modem and network speeds are usually
	quoted in bits) per second placed into the bucket, and maximum is the
	maximum number of bytes which can be in the bucket at any time.

	For example, if delay pool number 1 is a class 2 delay pool as in the
	above example, and is being used to strictly limit each host to 64kbps
	(plus overheads), with no overall limit, the line is:

delay_parameters 1 -1/-1 8000/8000

	Note that the figure -1 is used to represent "unlimited".

	And, if delay pool number 2 is a class 3 delay pool as in the above
	example, and you want to limit it to a total of 256kbps (strict limit)
	with each 8-bit network permitted 64kbps (strict limit) and each
	individual host permitted 4800bps with a bucket maximum size of 64kb
	to permit a decent web page to be downloaded at a decent speed
	(if the network is not being limited due to overuse) but slow down
	large downloads more significantly:

delay_parameters 2 32000/32000 8000/8000 600/8000

	There must be one delay_parameters line for each delay pool.

	Finally, for a class 4 delay pool as in the example - each user will
	be limited to 128Kb no matter how many workstations they are logged into.:

delay_parameters 4 32000/32000 8000/8000 600/64000 16000/16000

	for that ACL Squid returns a corresponding error page.

	The acl is typically the last acl on the http_access deny line which
	denied access. The exceptions to this rule are:
	- When Squid needs to request authentication credentials. It's then
	  the first authentication related acl encountered
	- When none of the http_access lines matches. It's then the last

 OPTIONS INFLUENCING REQUEST FORWARDING 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENT_END

NAME: nonhierarchical_direct
TYPE: onoff
LOC: Config.onoff.nonhierarchical_direct
DEFAULT: on
DOC_START
	By default, Squid will send any non-hierarchical requests
	(matching hierarchy_stoplist or not cacheable request type) direct
	to origin servers.

	If you set this to off, Squid will prefer to send these
	requests to parents.

	Note that in most configurations, by turning this off you will only
	add latency to these request without any improvement in global hit
	ratio.

	If you are inside an firewall see never_direct instead of
	this directive.
DOC_END

NAME: prefer_direct
TYPE: onoff
LOC: Config.onoff.prefer_direct
DEFAULT: off
DOC_START
	Normally Squid tries to use parents for most requests. If you for some
	reason like it to first try going direct and only use a parent if
	going direct fails set this to on.

	By combining nonhierarchical_direct off and prefer_direct on you
	can set up Squid to use a parent as a backup path if going direct
	fails.

	Note: If you want Squid to use parents for all requests see
	the never_direct directive. prefer_direct only modifies how Squid
	acts on cacheable requests.
DOC_END

NAME: always_direct
TYPE: acl_access
LOC: Config.accessList.AlwaysDirect
DEFAULT: none
DOC_START
	Usage: always_direct allow|deny [!]aclname ...

	Here you can use ACL elements to specify requests which should
	ALWAYS be forwarded by Squid to the origin servers without using
	any peers.  For example, to always directly forward requests for
	local servers ignoring any parents or siblings you may have use
	something like:

		acl local-servers dstdomain my.domain.net
		always_direct allow local-servers

	To always forward FTP requests directly, use

		acl FTP proto FTP
		always_direct allow FTP

	NOTE: There is a similar, but opposite option named
	'never_direct'.  You need to be aware that "always_direct deny
	foo" is NOT the same thing as "never_direct allow foo".  You
	may need to use a deny rule to exclude a more-specific case of
	some other rule.  Example:

		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
		acl local-servers dstdomain  .foo.net
		always_direct deny local-external
		always_direct allow local-servers

	NOTE: If your goal is to make the client forward the request
	directly to the origin server bypassing Squid then this needs
	to be done in the client configuration. Squid configuration
	can only tell Squid how Squid should fetch the object.

	NOTE: This directive is not related to caching. The replies
	is cached as usual even if you use always_direct. To not cache
	the replies see the 'cache' directive.

	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.
	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
DOC_END

NAME: never_direct
TYPE: acl_access
LOC: Config.accessList.NeverDirect
DEFAULT: none
DOC_START
	Usage: never_direct allow|deny [!]aclname ...

	never_direct is the opposite of always_direct.  Please read
	the description for always_direct if you have not already.

	With 'never_direct' you can use ACL elements to specify
	requests which should NEVER be forwarded directly to origin
	servers.  For example, to force the use of a proxy for all
	requests, except those in your local domain use something like:

		acl local-servers dstdomain .foo.net
		never_direct deny local-servers
		never_direct allow all

	or if Squid is inside a firewall and there are local intranet
	servers inside the firewall use something like:

		acl local-intranet dstdomain .foo.net
		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
		always_direct deny local-external
		always_direct allow local-intranet
		never_direct allow all

	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.

IFDEF: ICAP_CLIENT

DOC_START
	Defines a single ICAP service using the following format:

	icap_service service_name vectoring_point [options] service_url

	service_name: ID
		an opaque identifier which must be unique in squid.conf

	vectoring_point: reqmod_precache|reqmod_postcache|respmod_precache|respmod_postcache
		This specifies at which point of transaction processing the
		ICAP service should be activated. *_postcache vectoring points
		are not yet supported.

	service_url: icap://servername:port/servicepath
		ICAP server and service location.

	ICAP does not allow a single service to handle both REQMOD and RESPMOD
	transactions. Squid does not enforce that requirement. You can specify
	services with the same service_url and different vectoring_points. You
	can even specify multiple identical services as long as their
	service_names differ.


	Service options are separated by white space. ICAP services support
	the following name=value options:

	bypass=on|off|1|0
		If set to 'on' or '1', the ICAP service is treated as
		optional. If the service cannot be reached or malfunctions,
		Squid will try to ignore any errors and process the message as
		if the service was not enabled. No all ICAP errors can be
		bypassed.  If set to 0, the ICAP service is treated as
		essential and all ICAP errors will result in an error page
		returned to the HTTP client.

		Bypass is off by default: services are treated as essential.

	routing=on|off|1|0
		If set to 'on' or '1', the ICAP service is allowed to
		dynamically change the current message adaptation plan by
		returning a chain of services to be used next. The services
		are specified using the X-Next-Services ICAP response header
		value, formatted as a comma-separated list of service names.
		Each named service should be configured in squid.conf and
		should have the same method and vectoring point as the current
		ICAP transaction.  Services violating these rules are ignored.
		An empty X-Next-Services value results in an empty plan which
		ends the current adaptation. 

		Routing is not allowed by default: the ICAP X-Next-Services
		response header is ignored.

	ipv6=on|off
		Only has effect on split-stack systems. The default on those systems
		is to use IPv4-only connections. When set to 'on' this option will
		make Squid use IPv6-only connections to contact this ICAP service.

	Older icap_service format without optional named parameters is
	deprecated but supported for backward compatibility.

Example:
icap_service svcBlocker reqmod_precache bypass=0 icap://icap1.mydomain.net:1344/reqmod

	Configures an ordered set of similar, redundant services. This is
	useful when hot standby or backup adaptation servers are available.

	    adaptation_service_set set_name service_name1 service_name2 ...

 	The named services are used in the set declaration order. The first
	applicable adaptation service from the set is used first. The next
	applicable service is tried if and only if the transaction with the
	previous service fails and the message waiting to be adapted is still
	intact.

	When adaptation starts, broken services are ignored as if they were
	not a part of the set. A broken service is a down optional service.

	The services in a set must be attached to the same vectoring point
	(e.g., pre-cache) and use the same adaptation method (e.g., REQMOD).

	If all services in a set are optional then adaptation failures are
	bypassable. If all services in the set are essential, then a
	transaction failure with one service may still be retried using
	another service from the set, but when all services fail, the master
	transaction fails as well.

	A set may contain a mix of optional and essential services, but that
	is likely to lead to surprising results because broken services become
	ignored (see above), making previously bypassable failures fatal.
	Technically, it is the bypassability of the last failed service that

 	The named services are used in the chain declaration order. The first

	applicable service is applied to the successful adaptation results of
	the previous service in the chain.

	When adaptation starts, broken services are ignored as if they were
	not a part of the chain. A broken service is a down optional service.

	Request satisfaction terminates the adaptation chain because Squid
	does not currently allow declaration of RESPMOD services at the
	"reqmod_precache" vectoring point (see icap_service or ecap_service).

	The services in a chain must be attached to the same vectoring point
	(e.g., pre-cache) and use the same adaptation method (e.g., REQMOD).

	A chain may contain a mix of optional and essential services. If an
	essential adaptation fails (or the failure cannot be bypassed for
	other reasons), the master transaction fails. Otherwise, the failure
	is bypassed as if the failed adaptation service was not in the chain.

	If you want to disable collecting per-client statistics,
	turn off client_db here.

NAME: refresh_all_ims
COMMENT: on|off
TYPE: onoff
DEFAULT: off
LOC: Config.onoff.refresh_all_ims
DOC_START
	When you enable this option, squid will always check
	the origin server for an update when a client sends an
	If-Modified-Since request.  Many browsers use IMS
	requests when the user requests a reload, and this
	ensures those clients receive the latest version.

	By default (off), squid may return a Not Modified response
	based on the age of the cached version.
DOC_END

NAME: reload_into_ims
IFDEF: HTTP_VIOLATIONS
COMMENT: on|off
TYPE: onoff
DEFAULT: off
LOC: Config.onoff.reload_into_ims
DOC_START
	When you enable this option, client no-cache or ``reload''
	requests will be changed to If-Modified-Since requests.
	Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling this
	feature could make you liable for problems which it
	causes.

	see also refresh_pattern for a more selective approach.
DOC_END

NAME: maximum_single_addr_tries
TYPE: int
LOC: Config.retry.maxtries
DEFAULT: 1
DOC_START
	This sets the maximum number of connection attempts for a
	host that only has one address (for multiple-address hosts,
	each address is tried once).

	The default value is one attempt, the (not recommended)
	maximum is 255 tries.  A warning message will be generated
	if it is set to a value greater than ten.

	Note: This is in addition to the request re-forwarding which
	takes place if Squid fails to get a satisfying response.
DOC_END

NAME: retry_on_error
TYPE: onoff
LOC: Config.retry.onerror
DEFAULT: off
DOC_START
	If set to on Squid will automatically retry requests when
	receiving an error response. This is mainly useful if you
	are in a complex cache hierarchy to work around access
	control errors.
DOC_END

NAME: as_whois_server
TYPE: string
LOC: Config.as_whois_server
DEFAULT: whois.ra.net
DOC_START
	WHOIS server to query for AS numbers.  NOTE: AS numbers are
	queried only when Squid starts up, not for every request.
DOC_END

NAME: offline_mode
TYPE: onoff
LOC: Config.onoff.offline
DEFAULT: off
DOC_START
	Enable this option and Squid will never try to validate cached
	objects.
DOC_END

NAME: uri_whitespace
TYPE: uri_whitespace
LOC: Config.uri_whitespace
DEFAULT: strip
DOC_START
	What to do with requests that have whitespace characters in the
	URI.  Options:

	strip:  The whitespace characters are stripped out of the URL.
		This is the behavior recommended by RFC2396.
	deny:   The request is denied.  The user receives an "Invalid
		Request" message.
	allow:  The request is allowed and the URI is not changed.  The
		whitespace characters remain in the URI.  Note the
		whitespace is passed to redirector processes if they
		are in use.
	encode:	The request is allowed and the whitespace characters are
		encoded according to RFC1738.  This could be considered
		a violation of the HTTP/1.1
		RFC because proxies are not allowed to rewrite URI's.
	chop:	The request is allowed and the URI is chopped at the
		first whitespace.  This might also be considered a
		violation.
DOC_END

NAME: chroot
TYPE: string
LOC: Config.chroot_dir
DEFAULT: none
DOC_START
	Specifies a directory where Squid should do a chroot() while
	initializing.  This also causes Squid to fully drop root
	privileges after initializing.  This means, for example, if you
	use a HTTP port less than 1024 and try to reconfigure, you may
	get an error saying that Squid can not open the port.
DOC_END

NAME: balance_on_multiple_ip
TYPE: onoff
LOC: Config.onoff.balance_on_multiple_ip
DEFAULT: off
DOC_START
	Modern IP resolvers in squid sort lookup results by preferred access.
	By default squid will use these IP in order and only rotates to
	the next listed when the most preffered fails.

	Some load balancing servers based on round robin DNS have been
	found not to preserve user session state across requests
	to different IP addresses.

	Enabling this directive Squid rotates IP's per request.
DOC_END

NAME: pipeline_prefetch
TYPE: onoff
LOC: Config.onoff.pipeline_prefetch
DEFAULT: off
DOC_START
	To boost the performance of pipelined requests to closer
	match that of a non-proxied environment Squid can try to fetch
	up to two requests in parallel from a pipeline.

	Defaults to off for bandwidth management and access logging
	reasons.
DOC_END

NAME: high_response_time_warning
TYPE: int
COMMENT: (msec)
LOC: Config.warnings.high_rptm
DEFAULT: 0
DOC_START
	If the one-minute median response time exceeds this value,
	Squid prints a WARNING with debug level 0 to get the
	administrators attention.  The value is in milliseconds.
DOC_END

NAME: high_page_fault_warning
TYPE: int
LOC: Config.warnings.high_pf
DEFAULT: 0
DOC_START
	If the one-minute average page fault rate exceeds this
	value, Squid prints a WARNING with debug level 0 to get
	the administrators attention.  The value is in page faults
	per second.
DOC_END

NAME: high_memory_warning
TYPE: b_size_t
LOC: Config.warnings.high_memory
DEFAULT: 0 KB
DOC_START
	If the memory usage (as determined by mallinfo) exceeds
	this amount, Squid prints a WARNING with debug level 0 to get
	the administrators attention.
DOC_END

NAME: sleep_after_fork
COMMENT: (microseconds)
TYPE: int
LOC: Config.sleep_after_fork
DEFAULT: 0
DOC_START
	When this is set to a non-zero value, the main Squid process
	sleeps the specified number of microseconds after a fork()
	system call. This sleep may help the situation where your
	system reports fork() failures due to lack of (virtual)
	memory. Note, however, if you have a lot of child
	processes, these sleep delays will add up and your
	Squid will not service requests for some amount of time
	until all the child processes have been started.
	On Windows value less then 1000 (1 milliseconds) are
	rounded to 1000.
DOC_END

NAME: windows_ipaddrchangemonitor
COMMENT: on|off
TYPE: onoff
DEFAULT: on
LOC: Config.onoff.WIN32_IpAddrChangeMonitor
DOC_START
	On Windows Squid by default will monitor IP address changes and will 
	reconfigure itself after any detected event. This is very useful for
	proxies connected to internet with dial-up interfaces.
	In some cases (a Proxy server acting as VPN gateway is one) it could be
	desiderable to disable this behaviour setting this to 'off'.
	Note: after changing this, Squid service must be restarted.
DOC_END

NAME: max_filedescriptors max_filedesc
TYPE: int
DEFAULT: 0
LOC: Config.max_filedescriptors
DOC_START
	The maximum number of filedescriptors supported.

	The default "0" means Squid inherits the current ulimit setting.

	Note: Changing this requires a restart of Squid. Also
	not all comm loops supports large values.
