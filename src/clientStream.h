 \section Introduction Introduction
 \par
 *    A ClientStream implements a unidirectional, non-blocking,
 *    pull pipeline. They allow code to be inserted into the
 *    reply logic on an as-needed basis. For instance,
 *    transfer-encoding logic is only needed when sending a
 *    HTTP/1.1 reply.
 *
 \par
 *    Each node consists of four methods - read, callback, detach, and status,
 *    along with the stream housekeeping variables (a dlink node and pointer
 *    to the head of the list), context data for the node, and read request
 *    parameters - readbuf, readlen and readoff (in the body).
 *
 \par
 *    clientStream is the basic unit for scheduling, and the clientStreamRead()
 *    and clientStreamCallback() calls allow for deferred scheduled activity if
 *    desired.
 *
 \section OperationTheory    Theory on stream operation
 \par
 \li    Something creates a pipeline. At a minimum it needs a head with a
 *      status method and a read method, and a tail with a callback method
 *      and a valid initial read request.
 \li    Other nodes may be added into the pipeline.
 \li    The tail-1th node's read method is called.
 *
 \par
 *    For each node going up the pipeline, the node either:
 \li             satisfies the read request, or
 \li             inserts a new node above it and calls clientStreamRead(), or
 \li             calls clientStreamRead()
 \todo DOCS: make the above list nested.
 *
 \par
 *    There is no requirement for the Read parameters from different
 *    nodes to have any correspondence, as long as the callbacks provided are
 *    correct.
 *
 \section WhatsInANode Whats in a node
 *
 \todo ClientStreams: These details should really be codified as a class which all ClientStream nodes inherit from.
 *
 \par   Each node must have:
 \li    read method - to allow loose coupling in the pipeline. (The reader may
                      therefore change if the pipeline is altered, even mid-flow).
 \li    callback method - likewise.
 \li    status method - likewise.
 \li    detach method - used to ensure all resources are cleaned up properly.
 \li    dlink head pointer - to allow list inserts and deletes from within a node.
 \li    context data - to allow the called back nodes to maintain their private information.
 \li    read request parameters - For two reasons:
 \li        To allow a node to determine the requested data offset, length and target buffer dynamically. Again, this is to promote loose coupling.
 \li        Because of the callback nature of squid, every node would have to keep these parameters in their context anyway, so this reduces programmer overhead.
