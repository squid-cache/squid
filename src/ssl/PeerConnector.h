/**
 \par
 * Connects Squid client-side to an SSL peer (cache_peer ... ssl).
 * Handles peer certificate validation.
 * Used by TunnelStateData, FwdState, and PeerPoolMgr to start talking to an
 * SSL peer.
 \par
 * The caller receives a call back with PeerConnectorAnswer. If answer.error
 * is not nil, then there was an error and the SSL connection to the SSL peer
 * was not fully established. The error object is suitable for error response
 * generation.
 \par
 * The caller must monitor the connection for closure because this
 * job will not inform the caller about such events.
 \par
 * PeerConnector class curently supports a form of SSL negotiation timeout,
 * which accounted only when sets the read timeout from SSL peer.
 * For a complete solution, the caller must monitor the overall connection
 * establishment timeout and close the connection on timeouts. This is probably
 * better than having dedicated (or none at all!) timeouts for peer selection,
 * DNS lookup, TCP handshake, SSL handshake, etc. Some steps may have their
 * own timeout, but not all steps should be forced to have theirs.
 * XXX: tunnel.cc and probably other subsystems does not have an "overall
 * connection establishment" timeout. We need to change their code so that they
 * start monitoring earlier and close on timeouts. This change may need to be
 * discussed on squid-dev.
 \par
 * This job never closes the connection, even on errors. If a 3rd-party
 * closes the connection, this job simply quits without informing the caller.
