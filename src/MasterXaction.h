/** Master transaction details.
 *
 * Aggregates historical data from individual related protocol-specific
 * transactions such as an HTTP client transaction and the corresponding
 * HTTP or FTP server transaction.
 *
 * Individual transaction information worth sending or logging should be
 * recorded here, ideally without exposing other master transaction users
 * to internal details of individual transactions. For example, storing an
 * HTTP client IP address is a good idea but storing a pointer to some
 * client-side job which maintains that address is not.
 *
 * A master transaction is created by a newly accepted client connection,
 * a new request on the existing client connection, or an internal request
 * generated by Squid. All client-side protocols, including HTTP, HTCP, ICP,
 * and SNMP will eventually create master transactions.
 *
 * A master transaction is auto-destroyed when its last user is gone.
