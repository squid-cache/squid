.SH NAME
digest_file_auth \- File based digest authentication helper for Squid.
.PP
Version 1.1
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.if !'po4a'hide' .B digest_file_auth
.if !'po4a'hide' .B [\-c]
file
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B digest_file_auth
is an installed binary authentication program for Squid. It handles digest 
authentication protocol and authenticates against a text file backend.
.
This program will automatically detect the existence of a concurrency channel-ID and adjust appropriately.
It may be used with any value 0 or above for the auth_param children concurrency= parameter.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.if !'po4a'hide' .TP 12
.if !'po4a'hide' .B \-c
Accept digest hashed passwords rather than plaintext in the password file
.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
Username database file format:
.TP 6
- comment lines are possible and should start with a '#';
.
.TP
- empty or blank lines are possible;
.
.TP
- plaintext entry format is username:password
.
.TP
- HA1 entry format is username:realm:HA1
.
.PP
To build a directory integrated backend, you need to be able to
calculate the HA1 returned to squid. To avoid storing a plaintext
password you can calculate 
.B MD5(username:realm:password) 
when the user changes their password, and store the tuple 
.B username:realm:HA1.
then find the matching 
.B username:realm 
when squid asks for the HA1.
.PP
This implementation could be improved by using such a triple for
the file format.  However storing such a triple does little to
improve security: If compromised the
.B username:realm:HA1 
combination is "plaintext equivalent" - for the purposes of digest authentication
they allow the user access. Password synchronization is not tackled
by digest - just preventing on the wire compromise.
