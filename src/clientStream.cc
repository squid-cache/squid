 \par
 * A client Stream is a uni directional pipe, with the usual non-blocking
 * asynchronous approach present elsewhere in squid.
 *
 \par
 * Each pipe node has a data push function, and a data request function.
 * This limits flexability - the data flow is no longer assembled at each
 * step.
 *
 \par
 * An alternative approach is to pass each node in the pipe the call-
 * back to use on each IO call. This allows the callbacks to be changed
 * very easily by a participating node, but requires more maintenance
 * in each node (store the callback to the most recent IO request in
 * the nodes context.) Such an approach also prevents dynamically
 * changing the pipeline from outside without an additional interface
 * method to extract the callback and context from the next node.
 *
 \par
 * One important characteristic of the stream is that the readfunc
 * on the terminating node, and the callback on the first node
 * will be NULL, and never used.
 *
 \section QuickNotes Quick Notes
 \par
 * Each node including the HEAD of the clientStream has a cbdataReference
 * held by the stream. Freeing the stream then removes that reference
 * and cbdataFree()'s every node.
 * Any node with other References, and all nodes downstream will only
 * free when those references are released.
 * Stream nodes MAY hold references to the data member of the node.
 *
 \par
 * Specifically - on creation no reference is made.
 * If you pass a data variable to a node, give it an initial reference.
 * If the data member is non-null on FREE, cbdataFree WILL be called.
 * This you must never call cbdataFree on your own context without
 * explicitly setting the stream node data member to NULL and
 * cbdataReferenceDone'ing it.
 *
 \par
 * No data member may hold a reference to it's stream node.
 * The stream guarantees that DETACH will be called before
 * freeing the node, alowing data members to cleanup.
 *
 \par
 * If a node's data holds a reference to something that needs to
 * free the stream a circular reference list will occur.
 * This results no data being freed until that reference is removed.
 * One way to accomplish thisObject is to explicitly remove the
 * data from your own node before freeing the stream.
 *
 \code
   mycontext = thisObject->data;
   thisObject->data = NULL;
   clientStreamFree (thisObject->head);
   mycontext = NULL;
   return;
 \endcode
 *
 \todo rather than each node undeleting the next, have a clientStreamDelete that walks the list.
