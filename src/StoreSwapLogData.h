 *      When writing an object to disk, we must first write the meta data.
 *      This is done with a couple of functions.  First, storeSwapMetaPack()
 *      takes a StoreEntry as a parameter and returns a tlv linked
 *      list.  Second, storeSwapMetaPack() converts the tlv list
 *      into a character buffer that we can write.
 *
 \note  MemObject has a MemObject::swap_hdr_sz.
 *      This value is the size of that character buffer; the size of the
 *      swap file meta data.  The StoreEntry has a member
 *      StoreEntry::swap_file_sz that represents the size of the disk file.
 *      Thus, the size of the object "content" is
 \code    StoreEntry->swap_file_sz  - MemObject->swap_hdr_sz;    \endcode
 \note The swap file content includes the HTTP reply headers and the HTTP reply body (if any).
 *
 \par
 *      When reading a swap file, there is a similar process to extract
 *      the swap meta data.  First, storeSwapMetaUnpack() converts a
 *      character buffer into a tlv linked list.  It also tells us
 *      the value for MemObject->swap_hdr_sz.
