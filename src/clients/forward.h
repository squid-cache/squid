/** Construct an URI with leading / in PATH portion for use by CWD command

 *  This makes FTP absolute URI appear as:  ftp:host:port//root/path
 *  To encompass older software which compacts multiple // to / in transit
 *  We use standard URI-encoding on the second / making it
 *  ftp:host:port/%2froot/path  AKA 'the FTP %2f hack'.

 * \todo Should be a URL class API call.
