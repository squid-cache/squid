.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.if !'po4a'hide' .B basic_ncsa_auth
passwd file
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B basic_ncsa_auth
allows Squid to read and authenticate user and password information from an NCSA/Apache
httpd\-style password file when using basic HTTP authentication.
.PP
This password file can be manipulated using
.B htpasswd.
.
.PP
This authenticator accepts:
.BR
 * Blowfish \- for passwords 72 characters or less in length.
.BR
 * SHA256 \- with salting and magic strings.
.BR
 * SHA512 \- with salting and magic strings.
.BR
 * MD5 \- with optional salt and magic strings.
.BR
 * DES \- for passwords 8 characters or less in length.
.
NOTE: Blowfish and SHA algorithms require system-specific support.
.
.SH OPTIONS
The only parameter is the password file.
It must have permissions to be read by the user that Squid is running as.
.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.if !'po4a'hide' .RS
.if !'po4a'hide' .B basic_ncsa_auth /etc/squid/squid.pass
.if !'po4a'hide' .RE
.PP
.B basic_ncsa_auth
must have access to the password file to be executed.
.
.SH KNOWN ISSUES
.PP
DES functionality (used by htpasswd by default) silently truncates passwords to 8 characters.
Allowing login with password values shorter than the one desired.
This authenticator will reject login with long passwords when using DES.
