# Tests in this workflow file are slower or more expensive than build
# tests in quick.yaml. These tests improve build environment coverage, but
# most are unlikely to fail after quick.yaml tests succeed. Limiting these
# tests execution to staged commits optimizes CI responsiveness and
# costs while preserving decent quick.yaml problem detection probability.
#
# Anubis configuration must be kept in sync with the total number of
# tests executed for "auto" branch commits, including tests in other
# GitHub workflow file(s).
