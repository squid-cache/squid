 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * I have downloaded the multi-megabyte files from Netscape and Microsoft
 * that our users like to download from every mirror in the world,
 * defeating the usual caching.
 *
 * I put these files in a separate directory and installed a basic
 * redirector for Squid that checks if the file (so hostname and pathname
 * are disregarded) is present in this directory.
 *
 * After a few days of testing (the redirector looks very stable) it looks
 * like this is saving us approx. 15% on our cache flow. Also, our own WWW
 * server has become more popular than ever :)
 *
 * I'm sure this code will be useful to others too, so I've attached it at
 * the end of this message. Improvements, extensions etc. are welcome.
 *
 * I'm going on holidays now, so I won't be able to respond to e-mail
 * quickly.
 *
 * Enjoy, Richard.
