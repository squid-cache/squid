 \defgroup Tests            Unit Testing
 *
 \par
 *      Any good application has a set of tests to ensure it stays
 *      in a good condition. Squid tends to use cppunit tests.
 \par
 *      It is preferable to automated tests for units of functionality. There
 *      is a boilerplate for tests in "src/tests/testBoilerplate.[cc|h]". New
 *      tests need to be added to src/Makefile.am to build and run them during
 *      "make check". To add a new test script, just copy the references to
 *      testBoilerplate in Makefile.am adjusting the name, and likewise copy the
 *      source files. If you are testing an already tested area you may be able
 *      to just add new test cases to an existing script. I.e. to test the store
 *      some more just edit tests/testStore.h and add a new unit test method
 *      name.
