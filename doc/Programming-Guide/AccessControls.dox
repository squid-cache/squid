        These functions are responsible for allowing or denying a
        request, based on a number of different parameters.  These
        parameters include the client's IP address, the hostname
        of the requested resource, the request method, etc.  Some
        of the necessary information may not be immediately available,
        for example the origin server's IP address.  In these cases,
        the ACL routines initiate lookups for the necessary
        information and continues the access control checks when
        the information is available.
