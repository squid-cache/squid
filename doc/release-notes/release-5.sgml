<sect>Major new features since Squid-4
<p>Squid-5 represents a new feature release above Squid-4.

<p>The most important of these new features are:
<itemize>
	<item>ICAP Trailers
</itemize>

Most user-facing changes are reflected in squid.conf (see below).


<sect1>ICAP Trailers
<p>Details in <url url="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-rousskov-icap-trailers/" name="Draft: ICAP Trailers">

<p>The <em>Trailers</em> feature from HTTP is being proposed for addition to ICAP,
   with some modifications.

<p>This implementation complies with version -01 of that draft:
<itemize>
	<item>Announces ICAP Trailer support via the ICAP Allow request header field.
	<item>Parses the ICAP response trailer if and only if the ICAP server signals
		its presence by sending both Trailer header and Allow/trailers in the
		ICAP response.
</itemize>

<p>For now Squid logs and ignores all parsed ICAP header fields.
