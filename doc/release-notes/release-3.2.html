<H2><A NAME="s2">2.</A> <A HREF="#toc2">Major new features since Squid-3.1</A></H2>

<P>Squid 3.2 represents a new feature release above 3.1.</P>

<P>The most important of these new features are:
<UL>
<LI>SMP scalability</LI>
<LI>Helper Multiplexer and On-Demand</LI>
<LI>Helper Name Changes</LI>
<LI>Multi-Lingual manuals</LI>
<LI>Solaris 10 pthreads Support (Experimental)</LI>
<LI>Surrogate/1.0 protocol extensions to HTTP</LI>
<LI>Logging Infrastructure Updated</LI>
<LI>Client Bandwidth Limits</LI>
<LI> Dynamic SSL Certificate Generation</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Most user-facing changes are reflected in squid.conf (see below).</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1</A> <A HREF="#toc2.1">SMP scalability</A>
</H2>

<P>The new "workers" squid.conf option can be used to launch multiple worker
processes and utilize multiple CPU cores. The overall intent is to make
multiple workers look like one to an outside observer, while providing
knobs to customize each worker behavior if needed.</P>

<P>By default, all worker processes are configured identically and do what a
single Squid instance would have done. Squid.conf macro substitutions and
conditionals (see below) can be used to customize individual worker
configurations. In the paragraphs below, "can share" implies "will share by
default".</P>

<P>Workers can share HTTP, HTTPS, SNMP, ICP, and HTCP listening addresses.
Configuration related to ICP and HTCP clients must be adjusted to avoid
source address conflicts: Modify the IP address and/or the port used for
the protocol. Workers do not share DNS addresses by default because the OS
assigns each worker a unique DNS port.</P>

<P>Workers can share logs.</P>

<P>Workers cannot share caches, for now. Cache_dir options must be adjusted to
point each disk-caching worker to its own disk area. ICP and HTCP responses
are based on the responding worker cache state. Overall, SMP Squid behaves
as a Squid farm behind a load-balancer with no cache affinity awareness.
This is perfect for non-caching Squids but inappropriate for Squids that
must coordinate caching activities (in-between environments are in a gray
area requiring case-by-case analysis).</P>

<P>Cache manager and SNMP statistics are reported from a worker point of
view, for now.</P>

<P>Startup, reconfiguration, shutdown, and log rotation are handled as for a
monolithic Squid. Abnormally terminated workers are restarted while
other workers continue serving traffic.</P>

<H3>Squid.conf macros and conditionals</H3>

<P>Added support for process_name and process_number macros as well as simple
if-statement conditionals in squid.conf. These features allow individual
worker customization in SMP mode. For details, search for "Conditional
configuration" and "SMP-Related Macros" sections in squid.conf.documented.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2</A> <A HREF="#toc2.2">Helper Multiplexer</A>
</H2>

<P>The helper multiplexer's purpose is to relieve some of the burden
Squid has when dealing with slow helpers. It does so by acting as a
middleman between squid and the actual helpers, talking to Squid via
the multiplexed concurrent variant of the helper protocol and to the
helpers via the non-concurrent variant.</P>

<P>Helpers are started on demand, and in theory the muxer can handle up to
1k helpers per instance. It's up to squid to decide how many helpers
to start.</P>

<P>The muxer knows nothing about the actual messages being passed around,
and as such can't really (yet?) compensate for broken helpers.
It is not yet able to manage dying helpers, but it will.</P>

<P>To configure the multiplexer add its binary name (usually /usr/share/libexec/helper-mux.pl)
in front of the name of whichever helper is being multiplexed. It takes the helper binary
path and parameters as its own command parameters. The <EM>concurrency</EM> setting already
existing in Squid is used to configure how many child helpers it may run.</P>

<P>For example, a traditional configration is
<PRE>
        url_rewrite_program /your/redirector.sh
        url_rewrite_children 5
   
</PRE>

the alternative multiplexer configuration is:
<PRE>
        url_rewrite_program /usr/share/libexec/helper-mux.pl /your/redirector.sh
        url_rewrite_children 1 concurrency=5
   
</PRE>
</P>

<P>Helpers which are already concurrent protocol enabled gain little benefit from the multiplexer
on most systems. However on some systems where Squid spawning helpers causes excess memory usage
the reduction in direct helper spawned by Squid can result in a great reduction in resource use.</P>

<P>The helper can be controlled using various signals:
<UL>
<LI>SIGHUP: dump the state of all helpers to STDERR</LI>
</UL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3</A> <A HREF="#toc2.3">Helpers On-Demand</A>
</H2>

<P>Traditionally Squid has been configured with a fixed number of helpers and started them during
it's start and reconfigure phases. This forces the hard configuration problem of how many helpers
will be needed to be solved before starting Squid in production use.</P>

<P>The on-demand helpers feature allows greater flexibility and resolves this problem by allowing
maximum, initial and idle thresholds to be configured. Squid will start the initial set during
start and reconfigure phases. However over the operational use new helpers up to the maxium will
be started as load demands. The idle threshold determins how many more helpers to start if the
currently running set is not enough to handle current request loads.</P>

<P>For example, a traditional configration is
<PRE>
        auth_param ntlm /usr/libexec/squid/ntlm_auth
        auth_param ntlm children 200
   
</PRE>

the alternative on-demand configuration could be:
<PRE>
        auth_param ntlm /usr/libexec/squid/ntlm_auth
        auth_param ntlm children 200 startup=10 idle=2
   
</PRE>
</P>

<P>The example still permits up to 200 helpers to be running at once under peak traffic loads.
But only starts 10 when Squid is initialized resulting in a faster boot up.
When client requests threaten to overload the running helpers an additional 2 will be started.</P>

<P>NOTE: if no <EM>startup</EM> and <EM>idle</EM> values are specified the traditional behaviour
of starting the maximum number of helpers will occur.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4</A> <A HREF="#toc2.4">Helper Name Changes</A>
</H2>

<P>To improve the understanding of what each helper does and where it should be used the helper binaries
which are bundled with Squid have undergone a naming change in this release.</P>

<P>Below is a list of the old helper names and what their names have changed to.
For several helpers the directory name used in --enable-X-helpers configure option has also changed.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5</A> <A HREF="#toc2.5">Multi-Lingual manuals</A>
</H2>

<P>The man(8) and man(1) pages bundled with Squid are now provided online for all
versions and beginning with 3.2 they are available in languages other than english.</P>

<P>Details in 
<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/QualityOfService">The Squid wiki</A></P>

<P>3.1 began the Internationalization of Squid with the public facing error pages.
This move begins the Localization of the internal administrator facing manuals.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6</A> <A HREF="#toc2.6">Solaris 10 pthreads Support (Experimental)</A>
</H2>

<P>Automatic detection and use of the pthreads library available from Solaris 10</P>

<P>The result of this addition means that faster more efficient AUFS cache storage mechanisims
are now available in Solaris 10.</P>

<P>Support is experimental at this stage due to lack of feedback on the results of enabling it.
We recommend giving AUFS a try for faster disk storage and encourage feedback.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.7">2.7</A> <A HREF="#toc2.7">Surrogate/1.0 protocol extensions to HTTP</A>
</H2>

<P>The <EM>Surrogate</EM> extensions to HTTP protocol enable an origin web server to specify separate
cache controls for a reverse proxy acting on its behalf. Previously this was closely tied with the ESI
feature support in Squid. This release opens Surrogate support to all reverse proxies.</P>

<P>Reverse proxy requests sent on to the web server include the HTTP header <EM>Surrogate-Capabilities:</EM>
specifying the capabilities of the reverse proxy along with an ID which can be used to target reponses with
a <EM>Surrogate-Control:</EM> HTTP header used instead of the <EM>Cache-Control:</EM> header.</P>

<P>The default surrogate ID is generated automatically from the Squid site-unique hostname as found by the
automatic detection or manual configuration of <EM>visible_hostname</EM> although can be configured
separately with the <EM>httpd_accel_surrogate_id</EM> option.</P>

<P><EM>Security Considerations:</EM> Websites sould be careful of accepting any surrogate ID.
Older releases of Squid leak the Surrogate-Control headers to external servers.
This 3.2 series of Squid will now prevent this leakage of its own ID destined responses, however it is possible
and for some uses desirable to receive external reverse-proxies <EM>Surrogate-Capabilities:</EM> headers.</P>

<P><EM>NOTE:</EM> Several operating system distributions historically package Squid with a forced value of
<EM>visible_hostname localhost</EM>. If this is done on a Surrogate enabled install a manual re-configuration
is required to prevent an unacceptable surrogate ID of 'localhost' being generated.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.8">2.8</A> <A HREF="#toc2.8">Logging Infrastructure Updated</A>
</H2>

<P>The advanced logging modules introduced in Squid-2.7 are now available from Squid-3.2.</P>

<P>This feature is documented at http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/LogModules</P>

<P>The new infrastructure currently supports several different channels types (modules) ranging from
direct filesystem logging (stdio, daemon) to network logging (syslog, UDP and TCP). The daemon logging
interface allows for a custom helper to be written to process logs in real-time.</P>

<P>Upgrading: the <EM>access_log</EM> was previously logge via what is now called the <EM>stdio</EM> module.
This is still supported and used by default if no module is named. For best performance particularly in SMP
environments we recommend the <EM>daemon</EM> be used. The provided <EM>log_file_daemon</EM> helper
performs the traditional logging to local filesystem.</P>

<P>Additional to this the cache.log can now be limited to a smaller number of files stored.
Traditionally cache.log.N has been fixed at the same number of rotated files as access.log.N through the
<EM>logfile_rotate</EM> setting. The <EM>debug_options</EM> setting can now be used to configure the number
of debug cache.log files to rotate through with a <EM>rotate=N</EM> option. This is particularly useful for
logging a single cache.log at relatively high debug levels on a high-traffic system. Or one which is
required to store a long period of access.log and needs to conserve disk space.</P>

<P>The referer_log and useragent_log directives have been converted to built-in log formats.
These logs are now created using an access_log line with the format "referrer" or "useragent".</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.9">2.9</A> <A HREF="#toc2.9">Client Bandwidth Limits</A>
</H2>

<P>In mobile environments, Squid may need to limit Squid-to-client bandwidth
available to individual users, identified by their IP addresses. The IP
address pool can be as large as a /10 IPv4 network (4 million unique IP
addresses) and even larger in IPv6 environments. On the other hand, the code
should support thousands of connections coming from a single IP (e.g.,
a child proxy).</P>

<P>The implementation is based on storing bandwidth-related "bucket" information
in the existing "client database" hash (client_db.cc). The old code already
assigned each client IP a single ClientInfo object, which satisfies the
client-side IP-based bandwidth pooling requirements. The old hash size is
increased to support up to 32K concurrent clients if needed.</P>

<P>Client-side pools are configured similarly to server-side ones, but there is
only one pool class. See client_delay_pools,
client_delay_initial_bucket_level, client_delay_parameters, and
client_delay_access in squid.conf. The client_delay_access matches the client
with delay parameters. It does not pool clients from different IP addresses
together.</P>

<P>Special care is taken to provide fair distribution of bandwidth among clients
sharing the same bucket (i.e., clients coming from the same IP address).
Multiple same-IP clients competing for bandwidth are queued using FIFO
algorithm. If a bucket becomes empty, the first client among those sharing 
the bucket is delayed by 1 second before it can attempt to receive more
response data from Squid.  This delay may need to be lowered in 
high-bandwidth environments.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.10">2.10</A> <A HREF="#toc2.10">Dynamic SSL Certificate Generation</A>
</H2>

<P> SslBump users know how many certificate warnings a single complex site 
(using dedicated image, style, and/or advertisement servers for embedded content)
can generate. The warnings are legitimate and are caused by Squid-provided site
certificate. Two things may be wrong with that certificate:
<UL>
<LI> Squid certificate is not signed by a trusted authority.</LI>
<LI> Squid certificate name does not match the site domain name. </LI>
</UL>

Squid can do nothing about (A), but in most targeted environments, users will 
trust the "man in the middle" authority and install the corresponding root
certificate.</P>

<P>To avoid mismatch (B), the DynamicSslCert feature concentrates on generating
site certificates that match the requested site domain name. Please note that
the browser site name check does not really add much security in an SslBump
environment where the user already trusts the "man in the middle". The check
only adds warnings and creates page rendering problems in browsers that try to
reduce the number of warnings by blocking some embedded content. </P>

</H2>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>access_log</B><DD>
<P>New <EM>stdio</EM> module to send log data directly from Squid to a disk file.
This is the historic behaviour of Squid before logging modules were introduced, and
remains the default used when no module is selected.
It is recommended to upgrade logging to the faster <EM>daemon:</EM> module.</P>
<P>New <EM>daemon</EM> module to send each log line as text data to a file I/O daemon handling the slow disk I/O.
New installs, or installs with no logs configured explicitly will use this module by default.</P>
<P>New <EM>tcp</EM> module to send each log line as text data to a TCP receiver.</P>
<P>New <EM>udp</EM> module to send each log line as text data to a UDP receiver.</P>
<P>New format <EM>referrer</EM> to log with the format prevously used by referer_log directive.</P>
<P>New format <EM>useragent</EM> to log with the format prevously used by useragent_log directive.</P>

<DT><B>acl random</B><DD>
<P>New type <EM>random</EM>. Pseudo-randomly match requests based on a configured probability.</P>

<DT><B>auth_param</B><DD>
<P>New options for Basic, Digest, NTLM, Negotiate <EM>children</EM> settings.
<EM>startup=N</EM> determins minimum number of helper processes used.
<EM>idle=N</EM> determines how many helper to retain as buffer against sudden traffic loads.
<EM>concurrency=N</EM> previously called <EM>auth_param ... concurrency</EM> as a separate option.</P>
<P>Removed Basic, Digest, NTLM, Negotiate <EM>auth_param ... concurrency</EM> setting option.</P>

<DT><B>cache_dir</B><DD>
<P><EM>min-size</EM> option ported from Squid-2</P>

<DT><B>cache_peer</B><DD>
<P><EM>htcp-*</EM> options collapsed into <EM>htcp=</EM> taking an optional comma-separated list of flags.
The old form is deprecated but still accepted.</P>

<DT><B>clientside_mark</B><DD>
<P>New configuration parameter <EM>clientside_mark</EM></P>
<P>Allows packets leaving Squid on the client side to be marked with a Netfilter mark value in the same way as the existing clientside_tos feature.</P>
<P>This feature is only available for Netfilter environments.</P>

<DT><B>deny_info</B><DD>
<P>Support URL format tags. For dynamically generated URL in denial redirect.</P>

<DT><B>external_acl_type</B><DD>
<P>New format tags and option parameters:</P>
<P><EM>%SRCEUI48</EM> EUI-48 / MAC address of client from ARP lookup.</P>
<P><EM>%SRCEUI64</EM> EUI-64 of clients with SLAAC address.</P>

<P><EM>%&gt;bs</EM> Number of HTTP-equivalent message body bytes received from the next hop.</P>
<P><EM>icap::%&gt;bs</EM> Number of message body bytes received from the ICAP server.</P>
<P><EM>%&gt;lp</EM> Local TCP port used by transactions with http servers.</P>
<P><EM>%sn</EM> Unique sequence number per log line. Ported from 2.7</P>
<P><EM>%&lt;eui</EM> EUI logging (EUI-48 / MAC address for IPv4, EUI-64 for IPv6)
Both EUI forms are logged in the same field. Type can be identified by length or byte delimiter.</P>
<P><EM>%err_code</EM> The ID of an error response served by Squid or
a similar internal error identifier</P>
<P><EM>%err_detail</EM> Additional err_code-dependent error information.</P>

<DT><B>memory_pools_limit</B><DD>
<P>Memory limits have been revised and corrected from 3.1.4 onwards.</P>
<P>Please check and update your squid.conf to use the text <EM>none</EM> for no limit instead of the old 0 (zero).</P>
<P>All users upgrading need to be aware that from Squid-3.3 setting this option to 0 (zero) will mean zero bytes of memory get pooled.</P>

<DT><B>qos_flows</B><DD>
<P>New options <EM>mark</EM> and <EM>tos</EM> and <EM>miss</EM></P>
<P><EM>tos</EM> retains the original QOS functionality of the IP header TOS field.</P>
<P><EM>mark</EM> offers the same functionality, but with a netfilter mark value.</P>
<P>These options should be placed immediately after qos_flows.</P>
<P>The <EM>tos</EM> value is optional in order to maintain backwards compatability.</P>
<P>The preserve-miss functionality is available with the <EM>mark</EM> option and requires no kernel patching.
It does, however, require libnetfilter_conntrack.
This will be included by default if available (see the --without-netfilter-conntrack configure option for more details).</P>
<P><EM>miss</EM> sets a value for a cache miss. It is available for both the tos and mark options and takes precedence over the preserve-miss feature.</P>

<DT><B>tcp_outgoing_mark</B><DD>
<P>New configuration parameter <EM>tcp_outgoing_mark</EM></P>
<P>Allows packets leaving Squid on the server side to be marked with a Netfilter mark value in the same way as the existing tcp_outgoing_tos feature.</P>
<P>This feature is only available for Netfilter environments.</P>

<DT><B>tcp_outgoing_tos</B><DD>
<P>This parameter is now compatible with persistent server connections.</P>

<DT><B>windows_ipaddrchangemonitor</B><DD>
<P>Now only available to be set in Windows builds.</P>

<DT><B>url_rewrite_children</B><DD>
<P>New options <EM>startup=N</EM>, <EM>idle=N</EM>, <EM>concurrency=N</EM>
<UL>
<LI>startup=N allow finer tuning of how many helpers are started initially.</LI>
<LI>idle=N allow fine tuning of how many helper to retain as buffer against sudden traffic loads.</LI>
<LI>concurrency=N was previously called url_rewrite_concurrency as a distinct directive.</LI>

<DT><B>--enable-build-info</B><DD>

<DT><B>--enable-eui</B><DD>
<P>Enable Support for handling EUI operations.
This includes ARP lookups for MAC (EUI-48) addresses and the ACL arp type tests.</P>

<DT><B>--enable-log-daemon-helpers</B><DD>
<P>Build helpers for logging I/O.</P>

<DT><B>--enable-url-rewrite-helpers</B><DD>
<P>Build helpers for some basic URL-rewrite actions. For use by url_rewrite_program.
If omitted or set to =all then all bundled helpers that are able to build will be built.
If set to a specific list of helpers then only those helpers will build.
Currently one demo helper <EM>fake</EM> is provided in shell and C++ forms to demonstrate
the helper protocol usage and provide exemplar code.</P>

<DT><B>--with-swapdir=PATH</B><DD>
<P>Location to display in documentation for the default cache.
Updated to indicate /var/cache/squid in accordance with the filesystem layout standards.
Squid-3 no longer builds an implicit disk cache at this location, so the change is not expected
to have any effect on existing builds other than fixing some mysterious lack of core dumps.
The old /var/cache location was often non-writable which blocked core dumps creation.</P>

<DT><B>--without-netfiler-conntrack</B><DD>
<P>Disables the libnetfilter_conntrack library being used for the new qos_flows option <EM>mark</EM>.
default is to auto-detect the library and use where available.</P>

<DT><B>--enable-ssl-crtd</B><DD>

certificate request and instead enables the ssl_crtd processes.</P>
