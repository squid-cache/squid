<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1</A> <A HREF="#toc2.1">CVE-2009-0801 : NAT interception vulnerability to malicious clients.</A>
</H2>

<P>Details in Advisory 
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2011_1.txt">SQUID-2011:1</A></P>

<P>Squid locates the authority-URL details available in an HTTP request as
defined by RFC 2616 and validates that all found representations are
<EM>textually</EM> equivalent. In the case of intercepted traffic the
client destination IP is also compared to the Host: authority domains
DNS entries.</P>

<P>When the Host: authority contradicts another authority source Squid will log
"SECURITY ALERT: Host: header forgery detected". The response will then be determined
by the 
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/host_verify_strict/">host_verify_strict</A>
directive. Squid will respond with 409 Conflict error response when strict validation
fails and handles the request normally when strict validation succeeds or is OFF (default).</P>

<P>Relaying of messages which FAIL non-strict Host: validation are permitted through Squid but
only to the original destination IP the client was requesting or to explicit peers. This means
DNS lookups to locate alternative DIRECT destinations will not be done.</P>

<P>Known Issue: When non-strict validation fails Squid will relay the request, but can only do
so safely to the original destination IP the client was contacting. The client original
destination IP is lost when relaying to peers in a hierarchy. This means the upstream peers
are still at risk of causing same-origin bypass CVE-2009-0801 vulnerability.
Developer time is required to implement safe transit of these requests.
Please contact squid-dev if you are able to assist or sponsor the development.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2</A> <A HREF="#toc2.2">NCSA helper DES algorithm password limits</A>
</H2>

<P>Details in Advisory 
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2011_2.txt">SQUID-2011:2</A></P>

<P>The DES algorithm used by the NCSA Basic authentication helper has an
limit of 8 bytes but some implementations do not error when truncating
longer passwords down to this unsafe level.</P>

<P>This both significantly lowers the threshold of difficulty decrypting
captured password files and hides from users the fact that the extra bits
of their chosen long password is not being utilized.</P>

<P>The NCSA helper bundled with Squid will prevent passwords longer than 8
characters being sent to the DES algorithm. The MD5 hash algorithm which
supports longer than 8 character passwords is also supported by this helper
and should be used instead.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3</A> <A HREF="#toc2.3">SMP scalability</A>
</H2>

<P>The new "workers" squid.conf option can be used to launch multiple worker
processes and utilize multiple CPU cores. The overall intent is to make
multiple workers look like one to an outside observer, while providing
knobs to customize each worker behavior if needed.</P>

<P>By default, all worker processes are configured identically and do what a
single Squid instance would have done. Squid.conf macro substitutions and
conditionals (see below) can be used to customize individual worker
configurations. In the paragraphs below, "can share" implies "will share by
default".</P>

<P>Workers can share HTTP, HTTPS, SNMP, ICP, and HTCP listening addresses.
Configuration related to ICP and HTCP clients must be adjusted to avoid
source address conflicts: Modify the IP address and/or the port used for
the protocol. Workers do not share DNS addresses by default because the OS
assigns each worker a unique DNS port.</P>

<P>Workers can share logs.</P>

<P>Workers can share caches. Memory cache is automatically shared when multiple
workers are used. Cache_dir are shared when configured with the <EM>rock</EM>
storage type. Cache_dir of other types must be adjusted to point each
disk-caching worker to its own disk area. ICP and HTCP responses are based
on the responding worker cache state.</P>

<P>Cache manager statistics are reported from a worker point of view, for now.
Though some reports are combined. SNMP statistics are combined across all
workers.</P>

<P>Startup, reconfiguration, shutdown, and log rotation are handled as for a
monolithic Squid. Abnormally terminated workers are restarted while
other workers continue serving traffic.</P>

<H3>Squid.conf macros and conditionals</H3>

<P>Added support for process_name and process_number macros as well as simple
if-statement conditionals in squid.conf. These features allow individual
worker customization in SMP mode. For details, search for "Conditional
configuration" and "SMP-Related Macros" sections in squid.conf.documented.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4</A> <A HREF="#toc2.4">Helper Multiplexer</A>
</H2>

<P>The helper multiplexer's purpose is to relieve some of the burden
Squid has when dealing with slow helpers. It does so by acting as a
middleman between squid and the actual helpers, talking to Squid via
the multiplexed concurrent variant of the helper protocol and to the
helpers via the non-concurrent variant.</P>

<P>Helpers are started on demand, and in theory the muxer can handle up to
1k helpers per instance. It's up to squid to decide how many helpers
to start.</P>

<P>The muxer knows nothing about the actual messages being passed around,
and as such can't really (yet?) compensate for broken helpers.
It is not yet able to manage dying helpers, but it will.</P>

<P>To configure the multiplexer add its binary name (usually /usr/share/libexec/helper-mux.pl)
in front of the name of whichever helper is being multiplexed. It takes the helper binary
path and parameters as its own command parameters. The <EM>concurrency</EM> setting already
existing in Squid is used to configure how many child helpers it may run.</P>

<P>For example, a traditional configuration is
<PRE>
        url_rewrite_program /your/redirector.sh
        url_rewrite_children 5
   
</PRE>

the alternative multiplexer configuration is:
<PRE>
        url_rewrite_program /usr/share/libexec/helper-mux.pl /your/redirector.sh
        url_rewrite_children 1 concurrency=5
   
</PRE>
</P>

<P>Helpers which are already concurrent protocol enabled gain little benefit from the multiplexer
on most systems. However on some systems where Squid spawning helpers causes excess memory usage
the reduction in direct helper spawned by Squid can result in a great reduction in resource use.</P>

<P>The helper can be controlled using various signals:
<UL>
<LI>SIGHUP: dump the state of all helpers to STDERR</LI>
</UL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5</A> <A HREF="#toc2.5">Helpers On-Demand</A>
</H2>

<P>Traditionally Squid has been configured with a fixed number of helpers and started them during
it's start and reconfigure phases. This forces the hard configuration problem of how many helpers
will be needed to be solved before starting Squid in production use.</P>

<P>The on-demand helpers feature allows greater flexibility and resolves this problem by allowing
maximum, initial and idle thresholds to be configured. Squid will start the initial set during
start and reconfigure phases. However over the operational use new helpers up to the maxium will
be started as load demands. The idle threshold determines how many more helpers to start if the
currently running set is not enough to handle current request loads.</P>

<P>For example, a traditional configuration is
<PRE>
        auth_param ntlm /usr/libexec/squid/ntlm_auth
        auth_param ntlm children 200
   
</PRE>

the alternative on-demand configuration could be:
<PRE>
        auth_param ntlm /usr/libexec/squid/ntlm_auth
        auth_param ntlm children 200 startup=10 idle=2
   
</PRE>
</P>

<P>The example still permits up to 200 helpers to be running at once under peak traffic loads.
But only starts 10 when Squid is initialized resulting in a faster boot up.
When client requests threaten to overload the running helpers an additional 2 will be started.</P>

<P>NOTE: if no <EM>startup</EM> and <EM>idle</EM> values are specified the traditional behaviour
of starting the maximum number of helpers will occur.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6</A> <A HREF="#toc2.6">Helper Name Changes</A>
</H2>

<P>To improve the understanding of what each helper does and where it should be used the helper binaries
which are bundled with Squid have undergone a naming change in this release.</P>

<P>Below is a list of the old helper names and what their names have changed to.
For several helpers the directory name used in --enable-X-helpers configure option has also changed.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.7">2.7</A> <A HREF="#toc2.7">Multi-Lingual manuals</A>
</H2>

<P>The man(8) and man(1) pages bundled with Squid are now provided online for all
versions and beginning with 3.2 they are available in languages other than English (where translated).</P>

<P>Details in 
<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Translations">The Squid wiki</A></P>

<P>3.1 began the Internationalization of Squid with the public facing error pages.
This move begins the Localization of the internal administrator facing manuals.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.8">2.8</A> <A HREF="#toc2.8">Solaris 10 pthreads Support (Experimental)</A>
</H2>

<P>Automatic detection and use of the pthreads library available from Solaris 10</P>

<P>The result of this addition means that faster more efficient AUFS cache storage mechanism
is now available in Solaris 10.</P>

<P>Support is experimental at this stage due to lack of feedback on the results of enabling it.
We recommend giving AUFS a try for faster disk storage and encourage feedback.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.9">2.9</A> <A HREF="#toc2.9">Surrogate/1.0 protocol extensions to HTTP</A>
</H2>

<P>The <EM>Surrogate</EM> extensions to HTTP protocol enable an origin web server to specify separate
cache controls for a reverse proxy acting on its behalf. Previously this was closely tied with the ESI
feature support in Squid. This release opens Surrogate support to all reverse proxies.</P>

<P>Reverse proxy requests sent on to the web server include the HTTP header <EM>Surrogate-Capabilities:</EM>
specifying the capabilities of the reverse proxy along with an ID which can be used to target responses with
a <EM>Surrogate-Control:</EM> HTTP header used instead of the <EM>Cache-Control:</EM> header.</P>

<P>The default surrogate ID is generated automatically from the Squid site-unique hostname as found by the
automatic detection or manual configuration of <EM>visible_hostname</EM> although can be configured
separately with the <EM>httpd_accel_surrogate_id</EM> option.</P>

<P><EM>Security Considerations:</EM> Websites should be careful of accepting any surrogate ID.
Older releases of Squid leak the Surrogate-Control headers to external servers.
This 3.2 series of Squid will now prevent this leakage of its own ID destined responses, however it is possible
and for some uses desirable to receive external reverse-proxies <EM>Surrogate-Capabilities:</EM> headers.</P>

<P><EM>NOTE:</EM> Several operating system distributions historically package Squid with a forced value of
<EM>visible_hostname localhost</EM>. If this is done on a Surrogate enabled install a manual re-configuration
is required to prevent an unacceptable surrogate ID of 'localhost' being generated.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.10">2.10</A> <A HREF="#toc2.10">Logging Infrastructure Updated</A>
</H2>

<P>The advanced logging modules introduced in Squid-2.7 are now available from Squid-3.2.</P>

<P>This feature is documented at http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/LogModules</P>

<P>The new infrastructure currently supports several different channels types (modules) ranging from
direct filesystem logging (stdio, daemon) to network logging (syslog, UDP and TCP). The daemon logging
interface allows for a custom helper to be written to process logs in real-time.</P>

<P>Upgrading: the <EM>access_log</EM> and <EM>cache_store_log</EM> were previously logged via what is
now called the <EM>stdio</EM> module.
This is still supported and used by default if no module is named. For best performance particularly in SMP
environments we recommend the <EM>daemon</EM> be used. The provided <EM>log_file_daemon</EM> helper
performs the traditional logging to local filesystem.</P>

<P>Additional to this the cache.log can now be limited to a smaller number of files stored.
Traditionally cache.log.N has been fixed at the same number of rotated files as access.log.N through the
<EM>logfile_rotate</EM> setting. The <EM>debug_options</EM> setting can now be used to configure the number
of debug cache.log files to rotate through with a <EM>rotate=N</EM> option. This is particularly useful for
logging a single cache.log at relatively high debug levels on a high-traffic system. Or one which is
required to store a long period of access.log and needs to conserve disk space.</P>

<P>The <EM>referer_log</EM> and <EM>useragent_log</EM> directives have been converted to built-in log formats.
These logs are now created using an <EM>access_log</EM> line with the format "referrer" or "useragent".
They also now log all client requests, if there was no Referer or User-Agent header a dash (-) is logged.</P>

<P>Known Issue: The TCP logging module does not recover from broken connections well.
At present it will restart the affected Squid instance if the TCP connection is broken.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.11">2.11</A> <A HREF="#toc2.11">Client Bandwidth Limits</A>
</H2>

<P>In mobile environments, Squid may need to limit Squid-to-client bandwidth
available to individual users, identified by their IP addresses. The IP
address pool can be as large as a /10 IPv4 network (4 million unique IP
addresses) and even larger in IPv6 environments. On the other hand, the code
should support thousands of connections coming from a single IP (e.g.,
a child proxy).</P>

<P>The implementation is based on storing bandwidth-related "bucket" information
in the existing "client database" hash (client_db.cc). The old code already
assigned each client IP a single ClientInfo object, which satisfies the
client-side IP-based bandwidth pooling requirements. The old hash size is
increased to support up to 32K concurrent clients if needed.</P>

<P>Client-side pools are configured similarly to server-side ones, but there is
only one pool class. See client_delay_pools,
client_delay_initial_bucket_level, client_delay_parameters, and
client_delay_access in squid.conf. The client_delay_access matches the client
with delay parameters. It does not pool clients from different IP addresses
together.</P>

<P>Special care is taken to provide fair distribution of bandwidth among clients
sharing the same bucket (i.e., clients coming from the same IP address).
Multiple same-IP clients competing for bandwidth are queued using FIFO
algorithm. If a bucket becomes empty, the first client among those sharing 
the bucket is delayed by 1 second before it can attempt to receive more
response data from Squid.  This delay may need to be lowered in 
high-bandwidth environments.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.12">2.12</A> <A HREF="#toc2.12">Better eCAP Suport</A>
</H2>

<P>Support for libecap version 0.2.0 has been added with this series of Squid. Bringing
better support for body handling, and logging.</P>

<P>Known Issue: Due to API changes in libecap this release of Squid will not build
against any older libecap releases.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.13">2.13</A> <A HREF="#toc2.13">Cache Manager access changes</A>
</H2>

<P>The Squid Cache Manager has previously only been accessible under the cache_object://
URL scheme. Which has restricted its reporting to tools which can send arbitrary
URI to the proxy.</P>

<P>This version of Squid now provides access through the http:// and https:// URL schemes
allowing web browsers access without having to use the cachemgr.cgi gateway and enabling
the use of HTTPS security were desired.</P>

<P>The cache manager is available under the path prefix /squid-internal-mgr/. For example
the URL http://example/com/squid-internal-mgr/menu will bring up the manager menu. This
means there are some configuration changes required to lock down manager access.
The <EM>manager</EM> ACL needs changing. A built-in definition is now used, equivalent
to the following regex pattern:
<PRE>
        ^(cache_object://|https?://[^/]+/squid-internal-mgr/)
</PRE>
</P>

<P>The manager prefix /squid-internal-mgr/ with no action attempts to load an optional
template MGR_INDEX which may be installed amongst in the Squid error templates.
This template is not supplied with Squid but intended to be supplied by separate
cache manager applications as their front page embedding all scripts, accessors or
redirects required for their initial GUI display.</P>

<P>MGR_INDEX file
<UL>
<LI>should contain a complete HTML page, with optional client-side scripting.</LI>
<LI>must not contain server-side scripting. </LI>
<LI>will have macro substitution performed on it using the same macros as used by the error page templates.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>Version 3.2 of the CGI cache manager tool now presents XHR scripted probes to detect
proxies presenting these manager index pagess and provides direct HTTP/HTTPS web links
to those managers.</P>

<PRE>
        'always'  Keep most recently fetched objects in memory (default)
        
        'disk'    Only disk cache hits are kept in memory, which means
                  an object must first be cached on disk and then hit
                  a second time before cached in memory.
        
        network   Only objects fetched from network is kept in memory
        
</PRE>
</P>

<DT><B>memory_cache_shared</B><DD>

<H2><A NAME="modifiedtags"></A> <A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="#toc3.2">Changes to existing tags</A>
</H2>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>access_log</B><DD>
<P>New <EM>stdio</EM> module to send log data directly from Squid to a disk file.
This is the historic behaviour of Squid before logging modules were introduced, and
remains the default used when no module is selected.
It is recommended to upgrade logging to the faster <EM>daemon:</EM> module.</P>
<P>New <EM>daemon</EM> module to send each log line as text data to a file I/O daemon handling the slow disk I/O.
New installs, or installs with no logs configured explicitly will use this module by default.</P>
<P>New <EM>tcp</EM> module to send each log line as text data to a TCP receiver.</P>
<P>New <EM>udp</EM> module to send each log line as text data to a UDP receiver.</P>
<P>New format <EM>referrer</EM> to log with the format previously used by referer_log directive.</P>
<P>New format <EM>useragent</EM> to log with the format previously used by useragent_log directive.</P>

<DT><B>acl : random, urllogin</B><DD>
<P>New type <EM>random</EM>. Pseudo-randomly match requests based on a configured probability.</P>
<P>Ported <EM>urllogin</EM> option from Squid 2.7, to match a regex pattern on the URL login field (if any).</P>
<P>The <EM>manager</EM> ACL requires adjustment to cover new cache manager access. So it has now been
built-in as a predefined ACL name matching URLs equivalent to the following regular expression:
<PRE>
                ^(cache_object://|https?://[^/]+/squid-internal-mgr/)
        
</PRE>

squid.conf containing the old manager definition can expect to see ACL type collisions.</P>

<DT><B>auth_param</B><DD>
<P>New options for Basic, Digest, NTLM, Negotiate <EM>children</EM> settings.
<EM>startup=N</EM> determines minimum number of helper processes used.
<EM>idle=N</EM> determines how many helper to retain as buffer against sudden traffic loads.
<EM>concurrency=N</EM> previously called <EM>auth_param ... concurrency</EM> as a separate option.</P>
<P>Removed Basic, Digest, NTLM, Negotiate <EM>auth_param ... concurrency</EM> setting option.</P>
<P>Known Issue: NTLM and Negotiate protocols do not support concurrency. When set this option is ignored.</P>

<DT><B>cache_dir</B><DD>
<P><EM>min-size</EM> option ported from Squid-2</P>

<DT><B>cache_peer</B><DD>
<P><EM>htcp-*</EM> options collapsed into <EM>htcp=</EM> taking an optional comma-separated list of flags.
The old form is deprecated but still accepted.</P>

<DT><B>cache_store_log</B><DD>
<P>Now uses logging modules. Example: stdio:/file/path
see <EM>access_log</EM> for a list of supported modules and their parameters.</P>

<DT><B>clientside_mark</B><DD>
<P>New configuration parameter <EM>clientside_mark</EM></P>
<P>Allows packets leaving Squid on the client side to be marked with a Netfilter mark value in the same way as the existing clientside_tos feature.</P>
<P>This feature is only available for Netfilter environments.</P>

<DT><B>deny_info</B><DD>
<P>Support URL format tags. For dynamically generated URL in denial redirect.</P>
<P>Support the full range of 200-599 HTTP status codes.
3xx status only available when redirecting to a URI.
Other status only available when supplying an error template body.</P>

<DT><B>external_acl_type</B><DD>
<P>New format tags and option parameters:</P>
<P><EM>%SRCEUI48</EM> EUI-48 / MAC address of client from ARP lookup.</P>
<P><EM>%SRCEUI64</EM> EUI-64 of clients with SLAAC address.</P>
<P><EM>%EXT_LOG</EM> log= message returned by previous external ACL calls. An updated version may be returned.</P>
<P><EM>%EXT_TAG</EM> tag= value returned by previous external ACL calls. Tag may not be altered once set.</P>
<P><EM>children-max=N</EM> determines maximum number of helper processes used.</P>
<P><EM>children-startup=N</EM> determines minimum number of helper processes used.</P>
<P><EM>children-idle=N</EM> determines how many helper to retain as buffer against sudden traffic loads.</P>
<P>Deprecated <EM>children=N</EM> in favor of <EM>children-max=N</EM>.</P>

<DT><B>http_port act-as-origin vhost no-vhost</B><DD>
<P><EM>act-as-origin</EM> ported from 2.7.
This option corrects several HTTP header issues when operating as a reverse proxy and cache.
Notably the externally visible aging of objects stored in the server-side cache.</P>
<P><EM>vhost</EM> is deprecated. <EM>accel</EM> mode, reverse proxy, now defaults to always enable HTTP/1.1 virtual domain support.</P>
<P><EM>no-vhost</EM> option is added to disable the new reverse proxy behaviour.</P>

<DT><B>icap_send_client_ip</B><DD>
<P>Deprecated in favor of adaptation_send_client_ip
which applies to both ICAP and eCAP.</P>

<DT><B>icap_send_client_username</B><DD>
<P>Deprecated in favor of adaptation_send_username
which applies to both ICAP and eCAP.</P>

<DT><B>icap_uses_indirect_client</B><DD>
<P>Deprecated in favor of adaptation_uses_indirect_client 
which applies to both ICAP and eCAP.</P>

<DT><B>logformat</B><DD>
<P><EM>%&lt;a</EM> Server or Peer IP address from the last server connection (next hop).</P>
<P><EM>%&gt;bs</EM> Number of HTTP-equivalent message body bytes received from the next hop.</P>
<P><EM>icap::%&gt;bs</EM> Number of message body bytes received from the ICAP server.</P>
<P><EM>%sn</EM> Unique sequence number per log line. Ported from 2.7</P>
<P><EM>%&gt;eui</EM> EUI logging (EUI-48 / MAC address for IPv4, EUI-64 for IPv6).
Both EUI forms are logged in the same field. Type can be identified by length or byte delimiter.</P>
<P><EM>%err_code</EM> The ID of an error response served by Squid or a similar internal error identifier</P>
<P><EM>%err_detail</EM> Additional err_code-dependent error information.</P>
<P><EM>%&gt;la</EM> Rename of %la to indicate being a client connection detail.</P>
<P><EM>%&gt;lp</EM> Rename of %lp to indicate being a client connection detail.</P>
<P><EM>%&lt;p</EM> Server or Peer port number from the last server connection (next hop).</P>

<DT><B>memory_pools_limit</B><DD>
<P>Memory limits have been revised and corrected from 3.1.4 onwards.</P>
<P>Please check and update your squid.conf to use the text <EM>none</EM> for no limit instead of the old 0 (zero).</P>
<P>All users upgrading need to be aware that from Squid-3.3 setting this option to 0 (zero) will mean zero bytes of memory get pooled.</P>

<DT><B>qos_flows</B><DD>
<P>New options <EM>mark</EM> and <EM>tos</EM> and <EM>miss</EM></P>
<P><EM>tos</EM> retains the original QOS functionality of the IP header TOS field.</P>
<P><EM>mark</EM> offers the same functionality, but with a netfilter mark value.</P>
<P>These options should be placed immediately after qos_flows.</P>
<P>The <EM>tos</EM> value is optional in order to maintain backwards compatability.</P>
<P>The preserve-miss functionality is available with the <EM>mark</EM> option and requires no kernel patching.
It does, however, require libnetfilter_conntrack.
This will be included by default if available (see the --without-netfilter-conntrack configure option for more details).</P>
<P><EM>miss</EM> sets a value for a cache miss. It is available for both the tos and mark options and takes precedence over the preserve-miss feature.</P>

<DT><B>range_offset_limit</B><DD>
<P>Added ACL support for control over when the limit applies and when it is avoided.</P>

<DT><B>refresh_pattern</B><DD>
<P>New option <EM>max-stale=</EM> to provide a maximum staleness factor. Squid won't
serve objects more stale than this even if it failed to validate the object.</P>
<P>Removed option <EM>ignore-no-cache</EM>. Its commonly desired behaviour is obsoleted
by correct HTTP/1.1 Cache-Control:no-cache handling.</P>

<DT><B>reply_header_access</B><DD>
<P>Added support for custom response header names.</P>

<DT><B>request_header_access</B><DD>

<DT><B>reply_header_replace</B><DD>
<P>Added support for custom response header names.</P>

<DT><B>request_header_replace</B><DD>
<P>Added support for custom request header names.</P>

<DT><B>tcp_outgoing_address</B><DD>
<P>This parameter is now compatible with persistent server connections.
The IPv6 magic 'to_ipv6' hacks needed in 3.1 are now no longer necessary.</P>

<DT><B>tcp_outgoing_mark</B><DD>
<P>New configuration parameter <EM>tcp_outgoing_mark</EM></P>
<P>Allows packets leaving Squid on the server side to be marked with a Netfilter mark value in the same way as the existing tcp_outgoing_tos feature.</P>
<P>This feature is only available for Netfilter environments.</P>

<DT><B>tcp_outgoing_tos</B><DD>
<P>This parameter is now compatible with persistent server connections.</P>

<DT><B>url_rewrite_children</B><DD>
<P>New options <EM>startup=N</EM>, <EM>idle=N</EM>, <EM>concurrency=N</EM>
<UL>
<LI>startup=N allow finer tuning of how many helpers are started initially.</LI>
<LI>idle=N allow fine tuning of how many helper to retain as buffer against sudden traffic loads.</LI>
<LI>concurrency=N was previously called url_rewrite_concurrency as a distinct directive.</LI>
</UL>

This includes ARP lookups for MAC (EUI-48) addresses and the ACL arp type tests.</P>

<DT><B>--enable-log-daemon-helpers</B><DD>
<P>Build helpers for logging I/O.</P>

<DT><B>--enable-url-rewrite-helpers</B><DD>
<P>Build helpers for some basic URL-rewrite actions. For use by url_rewrite_program.
If omitted or set to =all then all bundled helpers that are able to build will be built.
If set to a specific list of helpers then only those helpers will build.
Currently one demo helper <EM>fake</EM> is provided in shell and C++ forms to demonstrate
the helper protocol usage and provide exemplar code.</P>

<DT><B>--with-swapdir=PATH</B><DD>
<P>Location to display in documentation for the default cache.
Updated to indicate /var/cache/squid in accordance with the filesystem layout standards.
Squid-3 no longer builds an implicit disk cache at this location, so the change is not expected
to have any effect on existing builds other than fixing some mysterious lack of core dumps.
The old /var/cache location was often non-writable which blocked core dumps creation.</P>

<DT><B>--without-netfiler-conntrack</B><DD>
