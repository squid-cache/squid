<sect>Major new features since Squid-@SQUID_RELEASE_OLD@
<p>Squid-@SQUID_RELEASE@ represents a new feature release above Squid-@SQUID_RELEASE_OLD@.

<p>The most important of these new features are:
<itemize>
	<item>Cache Manager changes
	<item>Removed purge tool
	<item>Remove deprecated languages
	<item>Remove Ident protocol support
</itemize>

<p>Most user-facing changes are reflected in squid.conf (see further below).

<sect1>Cache Manager changes<label id="mgr">
<p>For more information about the Cache Manager feature, see <url url="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/CacheManager/Index" name="wiki">.

<p>In order to reduce workload on the Squid development team we have chosen to stop
   providing several tools related to Cache Manager which have previously been
   bundled with Squid.

<sect2>Removal of the <em>squidclient</em> tool.
<p>Popular command-line tools such as <em>curl</em> or <em>wget</em>
   provide equivalent features. To access the cache manager, administrators
   can use for instance the command
   <em>curl -u user:&lt;cachemgr_passwd&gt; http://&lt;squid_hostname:squid_port&gt;/squid-internal-mgr/&lt;section&gt;</em>
   where <em>section</em> is the name of the desired cache manager report.
   To list available reports, use the report name <em>menu</em>.

<sect2>Removal of the <em>cachemgr.cgi</em> tool.
<p>Access to the Cache Manager API is available by sending HTTP(S) requests
   directly to Squid with the URL-path prefix <em>/squid-internal-mgr/</em>
   as described above. As Squid cache manager uses native HTTP(S),
   it is now possible to access it directly with a web browser.

<sect2>Removal of the <em>cache_object:</em> URI scheme.
<p>This custom scheme does not conform to RFC 3986 URI sytax. It has been replaced
   with Cache Manager access through HTTP and HTTPS URLs.

<sect2>Removal of <em>non_peers</em> Report
<p>Squid still ignores unexpected ICP responses but no longer remembers the
   details that comprised the removed report. The senders of these ICP messages
   are still reported to cache.log at debugging level 1 (with an exponential backoff).

<sect1>Removed purge tool
<p>The <em>purge</em> tool (also known as <em>squidpurge</em>, and <em>squid-purge</em>)
   was limited to managing UFS/AUFS/DiskD caches and had problems parsing non-trivial squid.conf files.

<p>The cache contents display and search it provided can be obtained with a script
   searching the cache manager <em>objects</em> report.

<p>This tool used the custom <em>PURGE</em> HTTP method to remove cache
   objects. This can be performed directly on any Squid configured to allow
   the method. Like so:
<verb>
    acl PURGE method PURGE
    http_access allow localhost PURGE
</verb>
    Any HTTP client (such as curl) can then be used to evict objects from the cache, for example:
<verb>
    curl -XPURGE --proxy http://127.0.0.1:3128 http://url.to/evict/
</verb>
   Alternatively the HTCP <em>CLR</em> mechanism can be used.

<sect1>Removed deprecated languages
<p>Old Squid used full language name to refer to error page translations.
   These have been deprecated since addition of ISO-639 language codes
   and support for HTTP Accept-Language negotiation in Squid-3.x.

<p>As of this release Squid will no longer provide the symlinks
   needed for seamless upgrade for squid.conf containing settings such as
<verb>
    error_directory English
</verb>
   All Squid installations are expected to already have them,
   or to convert to the ISO-639 equivalents. Existing symlinks are not
   affected.

<p>See <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/langpack/"> for the latest
   list of official Squid translations.

<p>See <url url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes"> for
   the full ISO-639 list. HTTP uses the 2-letter (set 1) codes.

<sect1>Removed Ident protocol support

<p>Ident protocol (RFC 931 obsoleted by RFC 1413) has been considered
seriously insecure and broken since at least 2009 when SANS issued an update
recommending its removal from all networks. Squid Ident implementation had its
own set of problems (that could not be addressed without significant code
refactoring).

<p>Configurations using ident/ident_regex ACLs, %ui logformat codes, %IDENT
external_acl_type format code, or ident_lookup_access/ident_timeout directives
are now rejected, leading to fatal startup failures.

<p>To avoid inconveniencing admins that do <em>not</em> use Ident features,
access logs with "common" and "combined" logformats now always receive a dash
in the position of what used to be a %ui record field.

<p>If necessary, an external ACL helper can be written to perform Ident transactions
and deliver the user identity to Squid through the **user=** annotation.

<sect>Changes to squid.conf since Squid-@SQUID_RELEASE_OLD@

This section gives an account of those changes in three categories:

<descrip>
	<p>No new directives in this version.

</descrip>

<sect1>Changes to existing directives<label id="modifieddirectives">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>acl</tag>
	<p>Changed <em>src</em> to detect and handle overlapping IP and
	   IP-range values. Merging where necessary.
	<p>Changed <em>dst</em> to detect and handle overlapping IP and
	   IP-range values. Merging where necessary.
	<p>Changed <em>localip</em> to detect and handle overlapping IP and
	   IP-range values. Merging where necessary.
	<p>Changed <em>ssl::server_name</em> to detect and handle overlapping
	   sub-domain and wildcard domains. Merging or ignoring where
	   necessary.
	<p>Changed <em>srcdomain</em> to detect and handle overlapping
	   sub-domain and wildcard domains. Merging or ignoring where
	   necessary.
	<p>Changed <em>dstdomain</em> to detect and handle overlapping
	   sub-domain and wildcard domains. Merging or ignoring where
	   necessary.
	<p>Changed <em>http_status</em> to detect and handle overlapping
	   status and status-range values. Merging where necessary.
	<p>Removed <em>ident</em> with Ident protocol support.
	<p>Removed <em>ident_regex</em> with Ident protocol support.

	<tag>buffered_logs</tag>
	<p>Honor the <em>off</em> setting in 'udp' access_log module.

	<tag>cachemgr_passwd</tag>
	<p>Removed the <em>non_peers</em> action. See the Cache Manager
	<ref id="mgr" name="section"> for details.

	<tag>dns_packet_max</tag>
	<p>Honor positive <em>dns_packet_max</em> values when sending DNS A queries
	and PTR queries containing IPv4 addresses. Prior to this change, Squid did
	not add EDNS extension (RFC 6891) to those DNS queries because 2010 tests
	revealed compatibility problems with some DNS resolvers. We hope that those
	problems are now sufficiently rare to enable this useful optimization for
	all DNS queries, as originally intended. Squid still sends EDNS extension
	with DNS AAAA queries and PTR queries containing IPv6 addresses (when
	dns_packet_max is set to a positive value). Rare deployments that must use
	buggy DNS resolvers should not set <em>dns_packet_max</em>.

	<tag>access_log</tag>
	<p>Built-in <em>common</em> and <em>combined</em> logformats now always
	receive a dash character ("-") in the position of what used to be a
	<em>%ui</em> record field.

	<tag>logformat</tag>
	<p>Removed <em>%ui</em> format code with Ident protocol support.

	<tag>email_err_data</tag>
	<p>Since Squid-7.2, the default for this directive is <em>off</em>.

	<tag>external_acl_type</tag>
	<p>Removed <em>%IDENT</em> format code with Ident protocol support.

	<tag>collapsed_forwarding</tag>
	<p>Squid no longer revalidates responses to collapsed requests, treating
	all such responses as fresh. This change follows IETF HTTP Working Group
	advice (in an HTTP gray area) and prevents arguably excessive freshness
	checks for responses to collapsed requests. This change does not prevent
	freshness checks for responses that were, at the time of a hit request,
	either fully cached or still receiving response body bytes.

	<tag>quick_abort_pct</tag>
	<p>Instead of ignoring <em>quick_abort_pct</em> settings that would,
	together with other conditions, abort a pending download of a 99-byte or
	smaller response, Squid now honors <em>quick_abort_pct</em> for all
	response sizes. Most Squids are not going to be affected by this change
	because default quick_abort_min settings (16KB) prevent aborts of 99-byte
	responses even before <em>quick_abort_pct</em> is checked.
	<p>Due to conversion from integer to floating point math, this change may
	affect responses larger than 99 bytes as well, but these effects ought to
	be limited to cases where the decision is based on a tiny difference (e.g.,
	receiving 1% more bytes would have triggered full download). In most such
	cases, the decision could probably go either way due to response header
	size fluctuations anyway.

<sect>Changes to ./configure options since Squid-@SQUID_RELEASE_OLD@
<p>
This section gives an account of those changes in three categories:

<itemize>
	<item><ref id="newoptions" name="New options">
	<item><ref id="modifiedoptions" name="Changes to existing options">
	<item><ref id="removedoptions" name="Removed options">
</itemize>

<sect1>New options<label id="newoptions">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>--without-gss</tag>
	<p>Renamed from <em>--without-gnugss</em>.

	<tag>--without-psapi</tag>
	<p>Disable auto-detection of Windows PSAPI library.

	<tag>--without-sasl</tag>
	<p>Disable auto-detection of Cyrus SASL (or compatible) library.

	<tag>CPPFLAGS=-DINCOMING_FACTOR=</tag>
	<p>Control the listening sockets responsiveness with poll(2) and select(2).
	   The higher the INCOMING_FACTOR, the slower the algorithm will
	   respond to load spikes/increases/decreases in demand. A value
	   between 3 and 8 is recommended. Default is 5.

</descrip>

<sect1>Changes to existing options<label id="modifiedoptions">
<p>
<descrip>

	<tag>--disable-arch-native</tag>
	<p>The <em>-march=native</em> compiler option is no longer used by
		default. It is possible to enable it by using the
		<em>--enable-arch-native</em> option.
		Using <em>-march=native</em> may cause problems when Squid is
		run on a system with a different exact CPU model than the one
		it is built on, or in some containerized environments.
		The symptom is crashes with "illegal instruction" errors.
		We do not recommend enabling this optimization in virtualized environments.

</descrip>
</p>

<sect1>Removed options<label id="removedoptions">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>--enable-cachemgr-hostname=</tag>
	<p>The <em>cachemgr.cgi</em> tool this option relates to has been removed.

	<tag>--enable-esi</tag>
	<p>Edge Side Includes (ESI) protocol is no longer supported natively.

	<tag>--without-expat</tag>
	<p>The ESI feature using libexpat has been removed.

	<p>The ESI feature using libxml2 has been removed.

	<tag>CPPFLAGS=-DHEADERS_LOG</tag>
	<p>The code enabled by this preprocessor macro has not built for many
	   years, indicating that the feature is unused.

	<tag>CPPFLAGS=-DMULTICAST_MISS_STREAM</tag>
	<p>The code enabled by this preprocessor macro has not built for many
	   years, indicating that the feature is unused.

	<tag>--disable-ident-lookups</tag>
	<p>The option was dropped during Ident protocol support removal.

</descrip>

<sect1>Other changes<label id="otherchanges">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>digest_edirectory_auth</tag>
	<p>LDAPS activation and referrals were broken, and memory could leak.
	   LDAPS may now negotiate correctly, referrals honor configuration
	   (use <em>-R</em> to disable), and memory is now properly freed.

	<tag>Adjusted configuration and format of ext_time_quota_acl helper debugging</tag>
	<p>The <em>-l</em> option that enables <em>ext_time_quota_acl</em> to log debug messages
		to a custom logfile has been removed, and their format has been
		changed to be in line with Squid's cache.log format.
