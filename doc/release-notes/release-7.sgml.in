<sect>Notice
<p>The Squid Team are pleased to announce the release of Squid-@PACKAGE_VERSION@ for testing.

This new release is available for download from <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v@SQUID_RELEASE@/"> or the
 <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/http-mirrors.html" name="mirrors">.

<p>While this release is not deemed ready for production use, we believe it is ready for wider testing by the community.

<p>We welcome feedback and bug reports. If you find a bug, please see <url url="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/BugReporting">
   for how to submit a report with a stack trace.

<sect1>Known issues
<p>Although this release is deemed good enough for use in many setups, please note the existence of

<sect>Major new features since Squid-@SQUID_RELEASE_OLD@
<p>Squid-@SQUID_RELEASE@ represents a new feature release above Squid-@SQUID_RELEASE_OLD@.

<p>The most important of these new features are:
<itemize>
	<item>Cache Manager changes
	<item>Removed purge tool
	<item>Remove deprecated languages
</itemize>

<p>Most user-facing changes are reflected in squid.conf (see further below).

<sect1>Cache Manager changes<label id="mgr">
<p>For more information about the Cache Manager feature, see <url url="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/CacheManager/Index" name="wiki">.

<p>In order to reduce workload on the Squid development team we have chosen to stop
   providing several tools related to Cache Manager which have previously been
   bundled with Squid.

<sect2>Removal of the <em>squidclient</em> tool.
<p>Popular command-line tools such as <em>curl</em> or <em>wget</em>
   provide equivalent features.

<sect2>Removal of the <em>cachemgr.cgi</em> tool.
<p>Access to the Cache Manager API is available by sending HTTP(S) requests
   directly to Squid with the URL-path prefix <em>/squid-internal-mgr/</em>.
   A plethora of tools, such as curl, wget, or any web browser, can be used
   instead of cachemgr.cgi.

<sect2>Removal of the <em>cache_object:</em> URI scheme.
<p>This custom scheme does not conform to RFC 3986 URI sytax. It has been replaced
   with Cache Manager access through HTTP and HTTPS URLs.

<sect2>Removal of <em>non_peers</em> Report
<p>Squid still ignores unexpected ICP responses but no longer remembers the
   details that comprised the removed report. The senders of these ICP messages
   are still reported to cache.log at debugging level 1 (with an exponential backoff).

<sect1>Removed purge tool
<p>The <em>purge</em> tool (also known as <em>squidpurge</em>, and <em>squid-purge</em>)
   was limited to managing UFS/AUFS/DiskD caches and had problems parsing non-trivial squid.conf files.

<p>The cache contents display and search it provided can be obtained with a script
   searching the cache manager <em>objects</em> report.

<p>This tool used the custom <em>PURGE</em> HTTP method to remove cache
   objects. This can be performed directly on any Squid configured to allow
   the method. Like so:
<verb>
    acl PURGE method PURGE
    http_access allow localhost PURGE
</verb>
    Any HTTP client (such as curl) can then be used to evict objects from the cache, for example:
<verb>
    curl -XPURGE --proxy http://127.0.0.1:3128 http://url.to/evict/
</verb>
   Alternatively the HTCP <em>CLR</em> mechanism can be used.

<sect1>Removed deprecated languages
<p>Old Squid used full language name to refer to error page translations.
   These have been deprecated since addition of ISO-639 language codes
   and support for HTTP Accept-Language negotiation in Squid-3.x.

<p>As of this release Squid will no longer provide the symlinks
   needed for seamless upgrade for squid.conf containing settings such as
<verb>
    error_directory English
</verb>
   All Squid installations are expected to already have them,
   or to convert to the ISO-639 equivalents. Existing symlinks are not
   affected.

<p>See <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/langpack/"> for the latest
   list of official Squid translations.

<p>See <url url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes"> for
   the full ISO-639 list. HTTP uses the 2-letter (set 1) codes.
