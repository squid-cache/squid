<sect>Notice
<p>The Squid Team are pleased to announce the release of Squid-@SQUID_VERSION@ for testing.

This new release is available for download from <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v@SQUID_RELEASE@/"> or the
 <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/http-mirrors.html" name="mirrors">.

<p>While this release is not deemed ready for production use, we believe it is ready for wider testing by the community.

<p>We welcome feedback and bug reports. If you find a bug, please see <url url="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/BugReporting">
   for how to submit a report with a stack trace.

<sect1>Known issues
<p>Although this release is deemed good enough for use in many setups, please note the existence of
<url url="http://bugs.squid-cache.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&amp;product=Squid&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;version=@SQUID_RELEASE@" name="open bugs against Squid-@SQUID_RELEASE@">.

<p>Support for compiling on HPUX with the native HP <em>xcc</em> compiler has been removed.
  To build on that OS/compiler combination, it is possible to pass these environment variables
  to ./configure: <em>CC="cxx -Ae" RANLIB=":"</em>

<p>This release adds a dependency on C++17 support in any compiler used to build Squid.
  GCC 8+ and Clang 8+ support C++17.

<sect1>Changes since earlier releases of Squid-@SQUID_RELEASE@

<sect>Major new features since Squid-@SQUID_RELEASE_OLD@
<p>Squid-@SQUID_RELEASE@ represents a new feature release above Squid-@SQUID_RELEASE_OLD@.

<p>The most important of these new features are:
<itemize>
	<item>TLS ServerHello
	<item>Log TLS Communication Secrets
	<item>Ban ACL key Changes in ACLs
	<item>Block to-local Traffic
	<item>RFC 9211: HTTP Cache-Status support
	<item>RFC 9111: Stop treating Warning specially
	<item>ext_kerberos_ldap_group_acl: Support -b with -D
	<item>Remove Gopher Protocol Support
	<item>Remove Outdated Tools
</itemize>

<p>Most user-facing changes are reflected in squid.conf (see below).

<sect1>TLS ServerHello
<p>Squid is now more lenient towards misconfigured <em>tls-cert=</em> file
   contents. Squid will attempt to sort the CA chain and send certificates in
   the order required by TLS ServerHello.

<p>Squid no longer sends the <em>tls-clientca=</em> on <em>https_port</em>
   server handshakes. This fix breaks misconfigured Squid deployments that
   (usually unknowingly) rely on the OpenSSL clientca 'leak' to build a
   complete https_port server certificate chain sent to TLS clients. Such
   deployments should add the right intermediate CA certificate(s) to their
   <em>tls-cert=</em> bundle (or equivalent).

<sect1>Log TLS Communication Secrets
<p>Squid now records pre-master secret and related encryption details for TLS
   connections accepted or established by Squid. These connections include
   connections accepted at <em>https_port</em>, TLS connections opened to
   origin servers/<em>cache_peer</em>/ICAP services, and TLS tunnels bumped by
   Squid using the SslBump feature.

<p>Logging of these details are controlled by the <em>tls_key_log</em>. See
   <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/tls_key_log/" name="squid.conf documentation">
   for details.

<sect1>Ban ACL key changes in ACLs
<p>More info in the <url url="https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/4a3b85322ce5a464175eb49ddb5be413794b25b8" name="commit description">.

<p>Certain Squid ACLs can check the value of a specific key=value where
   the key name is configurable. These ACLs are unable to check multiple
   different key names.

<p>Squid did write a cache.log ERROR for req_header/rep_header key changes
   but was silent about the preceding <em>note</em> ACL rules being
   ineffective after a key name change.

<p>Squid will now actively reject all such configurations.

<sect1>Block to-local Traffic
<p>More info in the policy change <url url="https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/f13e556e4ce743369dee4782b78c87d65580ab00" name="commit">
   and the ACL creation <url url="https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/6d2f8ed096bf5c013b8560451e41d8772c64ba66" name="commit">.

<p>This Squid introduces the <em>to_linklocal</em> ACL as pre-defined to
   match requests from 169.254.0.0/16 and fe80::/10.

<p>The default configuration settings are changed to:
<verb>
    http_access allow localhost
    http_access deny to_localhost
    http_access deny to_linklocal
    # http_access allow localnet
</verb>

<p>These changes only affect the default squid.conf and new installs.
   Upgraded installations will continue to use their previous settings.

<sect1>RFC 9211: HTTP Cache-Status support
<p>See also <url url="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9211" name="RFC 9211">.

<p>This HTTP header replaces <em>X-Cache</em> and <em>X-Cache-Lookup</em>
   which are no longer emitted by Squid. Any tools or management systems
   relying on those <em>X-</em> headers need to be upgraded to work with
   the new standardized header.

<sect1>RFC 9111: Stop treating Warning specially
<p>RFC 9111 obsoletes the Warning header, removing all specification
   requirements about it.

<p>This Squid changes behaviour in regards to that header:
<itemize>
<item>1) Squid no longer adds Warning headers to generated or forwarded
   messages. Miss responses from servers/peers and hits cached by an
   older version of Squid may still have Warning headers.

<item>2) On 304 revalidation, Warning header are treated the same as any
   other/generic header. They are added or replaced according to their
   presence in the 304 reply. Absent any Warning update by a 304, Squid
   may still deliver cached content with old Warning headers.

<item>3) Squid no longer validates received Warning headers. RFC 7234 placed
   syntax requirements and limits on how old some Warning values could
   be (when dated). Those checks are no longer being performed. The
   header value is now treated as an opaque string.

<item>4) Warning header usage and types are no longer tracked in message
   statistics available through cache manager.
</itemize>

<sect1>ext_kerberos_ldap_group_acl: Support -b with -D
<p>Previous versions of this helper ignore the <em>-b</em> option when
   the <em>-D</em> option is used.

<p>Fixing this limitation adds support for FreeIPA and limited subtree
   searching.

<sect1>Remove Gopher Protocol Support
<p>With this change, Gopher requests will be handled like any other request
   with an unknown (to Squid) protocol. For example, HTTP requests with
   <em>gopher://</em> URL scheme result in ERR_UNSUP_REQ.

<p>Default Squid configuration still considers TCP port 70 safe. The
   corresponding Safe_ports ACL rule has not been removed.

<sect1>Removed Outdated Tools
<p>We do not have enough resources/demand for maintaining these tools, they
   do require maintenance, and there are better tools available.

<itemize>
	<item><em>cache_diff</em> which has no users according to community
	  poll results in 2020.

	<item><em>GnuRegex</em> library implementation. Modern operating
	  systems provide a functioning regex library, so we do not need to
	  carry one anymore.

	<item><em>membanger</em> which has not built for many years.

	<item><em>pconn-banger</em> lacked build rules since inception (1997)
	  and probably could not be built manually since at least 2007.

	<item><em>recv-announce</em> which has not built for many years.

	<item><em>send-announce</em> which is very much outdated and unused
	  since the decline of the <url url="http://ircache.nlanr.net/" name="NLANR IRCache"> service.

	<item><em>tcp-banger2</em> is not built by default and probably could
	  not be built at all since at least 2006.

	<item><em>tcp-banger3</em> lacked build rules since inception (1998)
	  and probably could not be built manually (by mimicking tcp-banger2
	  build commands) without warnings since 2002.

	<item><em>tcp-banger.pl</em> has portability and code quality issues;
	  its basic functionality is supported by squidclient, wget, curl, and
	  others.

	<item<em>ufsdump</em> was not built by default since 2010 and its build
	  has been failing since before 2017.
</itemize>


<sect>Changes to squid.conf since Squid-@SQUID_RELEASE_OLD@
<p>
This section gives an account of those changes in three categories:

<itemize>
	<item><ref id="newdirectives" name="New directives">
	<item><ref id="modifieddirectives" name="Changes to existing directives">
	<item><ref id="removeddirectives" name="Removed directives">
</itemize>
<p>

<sect1>New directives<label id="newdirectives">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>paranoid_hit_validation</tag>
	<p>Controls whether to perform extra internal checks when loading
	   entries from the on-disk cache.

	<tag>cache_log_message</tag>
	<p>Configure logging options on a per-message basis, overriding the
	   per-section options. Message IDs are guaranteed stable across builds and
	   releases. Only a few messages support this for now.
</descrip>

<sect1>Changes to existing directives<label id="modifieddirectives">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>time units</tag>
	<p>All directives accepting time values now accept a time unit suffix
	   from nanosecond to decade.

	<tag>sslcrtvalidator_program</tag>
	<p>New <em>ttl=infinity</em> option to disable TTL expiry on stored helper responses.

	<tag>logformat</tag>
	<p>New <em>transport::&gt;connection_id</em> code to display which transport-level
	   connection the request was received.
	<p>New <em>busy_time</em> code to display the cumulative CPU time spent processing
	   the request, excluding the time spent waiting for external resources.
	   WARNING: this time is approximate and is known to have bugs and gaps,
	   so consider it a lower bound.
	<p>New <em>request_attempts</em> code to display how many forwarding attempts were
	   made for this request.
	<p>Squid now adds <em>ABORTED</em> to values printed by the <em>Ss</em> code in more
	   cases where a TCP Squid-to-server connection was closed prematurely.

	<tag>server_cert_fingerprint</tag>
	<p>Removed the broken <em>-sha</em> option. <em>SHA1</em> remains the default and
	   only supported fingerprinting algorithm. Configuring it is unnecessary.
</descrip>

<sect1>Removed directives<label id="removeddirectives">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>announce_file</tag>
	<p>Obsolete. Squid no longer provides functionality to enroll in the
	   cache registration service.

	<tag>announce_host</tag>
	<p>Obsolete. Squid no longer provides functionality to enroll in the
	   cache registration service.

	<tag>announce_period</tag>
	<p>Obsolete. Squid no longer provides functionality to enroll in the
	   cache registration service.

	<tag>announce_port</tag>
	<p>Obsolete. Squid no longer provides functionality to enroll in the
	   cache registration service.

	<tag>request_entities</tag>
	<p>Obsolete. Squid accepts an entity (aka payload, body) on
	   HTTP/1.1 GET or HEAD requests when a Content-Length or
	   Transfer-Encoding header is presented to clearly determine size.
	<p>To retain the old behaviour of rejecting GET/HEAD payloads
	   for HTTP/1.1 use <em>http_access</em> rules:
<verb>
  acl fetch method GET HEAD
  acl entity req_header Content-Length .
  http_access deny fetch entity
</verb>
	<p>Squid will reject use of Content-Length header on HTTP/1.0
	   messages with GET, HEAD, DELETE, LINK, UNLINK methods. Since
	   the HTTP/1.0 specification defines those as not having entities.
	   To deliver entities on these methods the chunked encoding
	   feature defined by HTTP/1.1 must be used, or the request
	   upgraded to an HTTP/1.1 message.

<sect1>Removed options<label id="removedoptions">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>--enable-cpu-profiling</tag>
	<p>This feature has been unreliable for many years. Other tools such as
	   oprofile provide better tracking and should be used instead.

	<tag>--enable-debug-cbdata</tag>
	<p>This feature has been of limited use since AsyncCalls feature
	   took over much of the CBDATA functionality.

	<tag>--enable-gnuregex</tag>
	<p>Squid no longer ships with a built-in GnuRegex implementation.

	<tag>--enable-kill-parent-hack</tag>
	<p>This feature has been deprecated for years. Other features such as
	   <em>--foreground</em> command line argument should be used instead.

	<tag>--enable-leakfinder</tag>
	<p>Removed. Using Valgrind for leak detection is still supported.

	<tag>--disable-loadable-modules</tag>
	<p>This option was performing the same duties as <em>--disable-shared</em>.

	<tag>--with-libcap</tag>
	<p>Replaced by <em>--with-cap</em>.

	<tag>--with-libxml2</tag>
	<p>Replaced by <em>--with-xml2</em>.
