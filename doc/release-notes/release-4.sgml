<sect>Notice
<p>
The Squid Team are pleased to announce the release of Squid-4.0.0 for testing.

This new release is available for download from <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/"> or the
 <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/http-mirrors.html" name="mirrors">.

<p>While this release is not deemed ready for production use, we believe it is ready for wider testing by the community.

<p>We welcome feedback and bug reports. If you find a bug, please see <url url="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/BugReporting">
   for how to submit a report with a stack trace.

<sect1>Known issues
<p>
Although this release is deemed good enough for use in many setups, please note the existence of

<sect>Major new features since Squid-3.5
<p>Squid 4 represents a new feature release above 3.5.

<p>The most important of these new features are:
<itemize>
	<item>Helper concurrency channels changes
	<item>Configurable helper queue size
	<item>SSLv2 support removal
	<item>MSNT-multi-domain helper removal
</itemize>

Most user-facing changes are reflected in squid.conf (see below).


<sect1>Configurable helper queue size
<p>The new queue-size=N option to helpers configuration, allows users 
to configure the maximum number of queued requests to busy helpers.

<sect1>Helper concurrency channels changes
<p> helper-mux.pl we have been distributing for the past few years to
    encourage use of concurrency is no longer compatible with Squid. If
    used it will spawn up to 2^64 helpers and DoS the Squid server.

<p> Helpers utilizing arrays to handle fixed amounts of concurrency
    channels MUST be re-written to use queues and capable of handling a
    64-bit int as index or they will be vulnerable to buffer overrun and
    arbitrary memory accesses.

<p> 32-bit helpers need re-writing to handle the concurrency channel ID
    as a 64-bit integer value. If not updated they will cause proxies to
    return unexpected results or timeout once crossing the 32-bit wrap
    boundary. Leading to undefined behaviour in the client HTTP traffic.

<sect1>SSLv2 support removal
<p>Details in <url url="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6176" name="RFC 6176">

<p>SSLv2 is not fit for purpose. Squid no longer supports being configured with
any settings regarding this protocol. That includes settings manually disabling
its use since it is now forced to disable by default. Also settings enabling
various client/server workarounds specific to SSLv2 are removed.


<sect1>MSNT-multi-domain helper removal

<p>The <em>basic_msnt_multi_domain_auth</em> helper has been removed. The
   <em>basic_smb_lm_auth</em> helper performs the same actions without extra
   Perl and Samba dependencies.


<sect>Changes to squid.conf since Squid-3.5
<p>
There have been changes to Squid's configuration file since Squid-3.5.

This section gives a thorough account of those changes in three categories:

<itemize>
	<item><ref id="newtags" name="New tags">
	<item><ref id="modifiedtags" name="Changes to existing tags">
	<item><ref id="removedtags" name="Removed tags">
</itemize>
<p>

<sect1>New tags<label id="newtags">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>tls_outgoing_options</tag>
	<p>New tag to define TLS security context options for outgoing
	   connections. For example to HTTPS servers.

	<tag>url_rewrite_timeout</tag>
	<p>Squid times active requests to redirector. This option sets
	   the timeout value and the Squid reaction to a timed out
	   request.

</descrip>

<sect1>Changes to existing tags<label id="modifiedtags">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>auth_param</tag>
	<p>New parameter <em>queue-size=</em> to set the maximum number
	   of queued requests.

	<tag>cache_peer</tag>
	<p>New option <em>tls-min-version=1.N</em> to set minimum TLS version allowed.
	<p>All <em>ssloptions=</em> values for
	   SSLv2 configuration or disabling have been removed.
	<p>Removed <em>sslversion=</em> option. Use <em>ssloptions=</em> instead.
	<p>Manual squid.conf update may be required on upgrade.

	<tag>external_acl_type</tag>
	<p>New parameter <em>queue-size=</em> to set the maximum number
	   of queued requests.

	<tag>http_port</tag>
	<p>All <em>option=</em> values for SSLv2
	   configuration or disabling have been removed.
	<p>Removed <em>version=</em> option. Use <em>options=</em> instead.
	<p>Manual squid.conf update may be required on upgrade.

	<tag>https_port</tag>
	<p>All <em>options=</em> values for SSLv2
	   configuration or disabling have been removed.
	<p>Removed <em>version=</em> option. Use <em>options=</em> instead.
	<p>New <em>options=SINGLE_ECDH_USE</em> parameter to enable ephemeral
	   ECDH key exchange.
	<p>Deprecated <em>dhparams=</em> option. Use <em>tls-dh=</em> instead.
	   The new option allows to optionally specify an elliptic curve for
	   ephemeral ECDH by adding <em>curve-name:</em> in front of the
	   parameter file name.
	<p>Manual squid.conf update may be required on upgrade.

	<tag>sslcrtd_children</tag>
	<p>New parameter <em>queue-size=</em> to set the maximum number
	   of queued requests.

	<tag>sslcrtvalidator_children</tag>
	<p>New parameter <em>queue-size=</em> to set the maximum number
	   of queued requests.

	<tag>url_rewrite_children</tag>
	<p>New parameter <em>queue-size=</em> to set the maximum number
	   of queued requests.

</descrip>

<sect1>Removed tags<label id="removedtags">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>cache_peer_domain</tag>
	<p>Superceded by <em>cache_peer_access</em>. Use dstdomain ACL
	   in the access control list to restrict domains requested.

	<tag>refresh_pattern</tag>
	<p>Option <em>ignore-auth</em> removed. Its original intent was
	   to improve caching. HTTP/1.1 permits caching of authenticated
	   messages under conditions which Squid does check for and obey.

	<tag>sslproxy_cafile</tag>
	<p>Replaced by <em>tls_outgoing_options cafile=</em>.

	<tag>sslproxy_capath</tag>
	<p>Replaced by <em>tls_outgoing_options capath=</em>.

	<tag>sslproxy_cipher</tag>
	<p>Replaced by <em>tls_outgoing_options cipher=</em>.

	<p>Replaced by <em>tls_outgoing_options flags=</em>.

	<tag>sslproxy_options</tag>
	<p>Replaced by <em>tls_outgoing_options options=</em>.
	<p>All values for SSLv2 configuration or disabling have been removed.
	<p>Manual squid.conf update may be required on upgrade.

	<tag>sslproxy_version</tag>
	<p>Replaced by <em>tls_outgoing_options options=</em>.
	<p>All values for SSLv2 configuration or disabling have been removed.
