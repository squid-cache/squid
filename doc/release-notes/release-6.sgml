<sect>Notice
<p>The Squid Team are pleased to announce the release of Squid-6.0.0 for testing.

This new release is available for download from <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v6/"> or the
 <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/http-mirrors.html" name="mirrors">.

<p>While this release is not deemed ready for production use, we believe it is ready for wider testing by the community.

<p>We welcome feedback and bug reports. If you find a bug, please see <url url="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/BugReporting">
   for how to submit a report with a stack trace.

<sect1>Known issues
<p>Although this release is deemed good enough for use in many setups, please note the existence of
<url url="http://bugs.squid-cache.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&amp;product=Squid&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;version=6" name="open bugs against Squid-6">.
<p>Support for compiling on HPUX with the native HP <em>xcc</em> compiler has been removed. To build on that OS/compiler combination, it is possible to pass these environemnt variables to ./configure: <em>CC="cxx -Ae" RANLIB=":"</em>

<sect>Major new features since Squid-5
<p>Squid-6 represents a new feature release above Squid-5.

<p>The most important of these new features are:
<itemize>
	<item>No new features documented yet.
</itemize>

Most user-facing changes are reflected in squid.conf (see below).


<sect>Changes to squid.conf since Squid-5
<p>
This section gives an account of those changes in three categories:

<itemize>
	<item><ref id="newdirectives" name="New directives">
	<item><ref id="modifieddirectives" name="Changes to existing directives">
	<item><ref id="removeddirectives" name="Removed directives">
</itemize>
<p>

<sect1>New directives<label id="newdirectives">
<p>
<descrip>
	<p>There have been no directives added.
</descrip>

<sect1>Changes to existing directives<label id="modifieddirectives">
<p>
<descrip>
	<p>There have been no directives changed.

<sect1>Removed directives<label id="removeddirectives">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>request_entities</tag>
	<p>Obsolete. Squid accepts an entity (aka payload, body) on
	   HTTP/1.1 GET or HEAD requests when a Content-Length or
	   Transfer-Encoding header is presented to clearly determine size.
	<p>To retain the old behaviour of rejecting GET/HEAD payloads
	   for HTTP/1.1 use <em>http_access</em> rules:
<verb>
  acl fetch method GET HEAD
  acl entity req_header Content-Length .
  http_access deny fetch entity
</verb>
	<p>Squid will reject use of Content-Length header on HTTP/1.0
	   messages with GET, HEAD, DELETE, LINK, UNLINK methods. Since
	   the HTTP/1.0 specification defines those as not having entities.
	   To deliver entities on these methods the chunked encoding
	   feature defined by HTTP/1.1 must be used, or the request
	   upgraded to an HTTP/1.1 message.
</descrip>


<sect>Changes to ./configure options since Squid-5
<p>
This section gives an account of those changes in three categories:

<itemize>
	<item><ref id="newoptions" name="New options">
	<item><ref id="modifiedoptions" name="Changes to existing options">
	<item><ref id="removedoptions" name="Removed options">
</itemize>


<sect1>New options<label id="newoptions">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>--with-cap</tag>
	<p>Replacement for <em>--with-libcap</em>.

	<tag>--with-xml2</tag>
	<p>Replacement for <em>--with-libxml2</em>.

</descrip>

<sect1>Changes to existing options<label id="modifiedoptions">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>logformat</tag>
	<p>More logged <em>Ss</em> code values may contain an <em>_ABORTED</em>
	suffix because Squid now adds that suffix in more cases where a TCP
	Squid-to-server connection was closed prematurely (e.g., an EOF in the
	middle of a chunked HTTP response body transfer). In general, tools
	processing <em>Ss</em> code values should treat each value as an
	underscore-delimited list of tags rather than an enumeration of a few
	hard-coded values.

	<p>This change affects all <em>Ss</em> code uses, not just those specific to
	the <em>logformat</em> directive.

</descrip>
</p>

<sect1>Removed options<label id="removedoptions">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>--enable-cpu-profiling</tag>
	<p>This feature has been unreliable for many years. Other tools such as
	   oprofile provide better tracking and should be used instead.

	<tag>--enable-debug-cbdata</tag>
	<p>This feature has been of limited use since AsyncCalls feature
	   took over much of the CBDATA functionality.

	<tag>--enable-kill-parent-hack</tag>
	<p>This feature has been deprecated for years. Other features such as
	   <em>--foreground</em> command line argument should be used instead.

	<tag>--disable-loadable-modules</tag>
	<p>This option was performing the same duties as <em>--disable-shared</em>.

	<tag>--with-libcap</tag>
	<p>Replaced by <em>--with-cap</em>.

	<tag>--with-libxml2</tag>
	<p>Replaced by <em>--with-xml2</em>.

</descrip>


<sect>Regressions since Squid-2.7

<p>Some squid.conf options which were available in Squid-2.7 are not yet available in Squid-5
