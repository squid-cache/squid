<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3</A> <A HREF="#toc1.3">Copyright disclaimer adjustments</A>
</H2>

<P>Squid sources are now administered by the Squid Software Foundation on
behalf of the Squid Project and community.</P>

<P>This version of Squid contains initial changes to streamline copyright
declarations in Squid sources and related metafiles. No functionality
or licensing changes are intended.</P>

<P>Once completed, the changes will consistently declare Squid contributors
(listed in CONTRIBUTORS and represented by the Squid Software Foundation) as
Squid copyright owners while referring the reader to the COPYING file for GPL
licensing details. The boilerplate with the above information is provided.</P>

<P>These changes do not affect copyright rights of individuals or organizations.
We are simply confirming the fact that there are many Squid copyright owners,
just like there are many Linux kernel copyright owners. We are also providing
a simple, consistent way to document that fact.</P>


<H2><A NAME="s2">2.</A> <A HREF="#toc2">Major new features since Squid-3.4</A></H2>

<P>Squid 3.5 represents a new feature release above 3.4.</P>

<P>The most important of these new features are:
<UL>
<LI>Support libecap v1.0</LI>
<LI>Authentication helper query extensions</LI>
<LI>Support named services</LI>
<LI>Upgraded squidclient tool</LI>
<LI>Helper support for concurrency channels</LI>
<LI>Native FTP Relay</LI>
<LI>Receive PROXY protocol, Versions 1 &amp; 2</LI>
<LI>Basic authentication MSNT helper changes</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Most user-facing changes are reflected in squid.conf (see below).</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1</A> <A HREF="#toc2.1">Support libecap v1.0</A>
</H2>

<P>Details at 
<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/eCAP">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/eCAP</A>.</P>

<P>The new libecap version allows Squid to better check the version of
the eCAP adapter being loaded as well as the version of the eCAP library
being used.</P>

<P>Squid-3.5 can support eCAP adapters built with libecap v1.0,
but no longer supports adapters built with earlier libecap versions
due to API changes.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2</A> <A HREF="#toc2.2">Authentication helper query extensions</A>
</H2>

<P>Details at 
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/auth_param/">http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/auth_param/</A>.</P>

<P>The new <EM>key_extras</EM> parameter allows sending of additional
details to the authentication helper beyond the minimum required for
the HTTP authentication. This is primarily intended to allow switching
of authentication databases based on criteria such as client IP subnet,
Squid receiving port, or in reverse-proxy the requested domain name.</P>

<P>In theory any <EM>logformat</EM> code may be used, however only the
codes which have available details at the time of authentication
will send any meaningful detail.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3</A> <A HREF="#toc2.3">Support named services</A>
</H2>

<P>Details at 
<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/MultipleInstances">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/MultipleInstances</A>.</P>
<P>Terminology details at 
<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SmpScale#Terminology">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SmpScale#Terminology</A>.</P>

<P>The command line option <EM>-n</EM> assigns a name to the Squid service
instance to be used as a unique identifier for all SMP processes run as
part of that instance. This allows multiple instances of Squid service to
be run on a single machine without background SMP systems such as shared
memory and inter-process communication becoming confused or requiring
additional configuration.</P>

<P>A service name is always used. When the <EM>-n</EM> option is missing
from the command line the default service name is <EM>squid</EM>.</P>

<P>When multiple instances are being run the <EM>-n</EM> service name is
required to target all other options such as <EM>-z</EM> or <EM>-k</EM>
commands at the correct service.</P>

<P>The squid.conf macro ${service_name} is added to provide the service name
of the process parsing the config.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4</A> <A HREF="#toc2.4">Upgraded squidclient tool</A>
</H2>

<P>Details at 
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/manuals/squidclient.html">http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/manuals/squidclient.html</A>.</P>

<P>The <EM>squidclient</EM> has begun the process of upgrading to support
protocols other than HTTP.</P>

<H3>Debug levels</H3>

<P>The tool displays the server response message on STDOUT unless the <EM>-q</EM>
command line option is used. Error messages will be output to STDERR.
All other possible output is considered debug and output to STDERR using
a range of debug verbosity levels (currently 1, 2 and 3).</P>

<P>When the <EM>-v</EM> command line option is used debugging is enabled.
The level of debug display is raised for each repetition of the option.</P>

<H3>PING</H3>

<P>When <EM>--ping</EM> is given the tool will send its message repeatedly
using whichever protocol that message has been formatted for.
Optional parameters to limit the number of pings and their frequency are
available.</P>

<P>Older tool versions also provide this feature but require the loop count
parameter to be set to enable use of the feature.</P>

<H3>HTTPS</H3>

<P>When Squid is built with the GnuTLS encryption library the tool is able
to open TLS (or SSL/3.0) connections to servers.</P>

<P>The <EM>--https</EM> option enables TLS using default values.</P>

<P>The <EM>--cert</EM> option specifies a file containing X.509 client
certificate and private key in PEM format to be loaded for use. Multiple
certificates are supported and the option may be used multiple times to
load certificates.
The default is not to use a client certificate.</P>

<P>The <EM>--params</EM> option specifies a library specific set of parameters
to be sent to the library for configuring the security context.
See 
<A HREF="http://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Priority-Strings.html">http://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Priority-Strings.html</A> for
available GnuTLS parameters.</P>

<P>The <EM>--trusted-ca</EM> option specifies a file in PEM format containing
one or more Certificate Authority (CA) certificates used to verify the
remote server. This option may be used multiple times to load additional
CA certificate lists.
The default is not to use any CA, nor trust any server.</P>

<P>Anonymous TLS (using non-authenticated Diffi-Hellman or Elliptic Curve
encryption) is available with the <EM>--anonymous-tls</EM> option.
The default is to use X.509 certificate encryption instead.</P>

<P>When performing TLS/SSL server certificates are always verified, the
results shown at debug level 3. The encrypted type is displayed at debug
level 2 and the connection is used to send and receive the messages
regardless of verification results.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5</A> <A HREF="#toc2.5">Helper support for concurrency channels</A>
</H2>

<P>Helper concurrency greatly reduces the communication lag between Squid
and its helpers allowing faster transaction speeds even on sequential
helpers.</P>

<P>The Digest authentication, Store-ID, and URL-rewrite helpers packaged
with Squid have been updated to support concurrency channels. They will
auto-detect the <EM>channel-ID</EM> field and will produce the appropriate
response format.
With these helpers concurrency may now be set to 0 or any higher number as desired.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6</A> <A HREF="#toc2.6">Native FTP Relay</A>
</H2>

<P>Details at 
<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/FtpRelay">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/FtpRelay</A>.</P>

<P>Squid is now capable of accepting native FTP commands and relaying native
FTP messages between FTP clients and FTP servers. Native FTP commands
accepted at ftp_port are internally converted or wrapped into HTTP-like
messages. The same happens to Native FTP responses received from FTP origin
servers. Those HTTP-like messages are shoveled through regular access
control and adaptation layers between the FTP client and the FTP origin
server. This allows Squid to examine, adapt, block, and log FTP exchanges.
Squid reuses most HTTP mechanisms when shoveling wrapped FTP messages. For
example, http_access and adaptation_access directives are used.</P>

<P>FTP Relay is a new, experimental, complex feature that has seen limited
production exposure. Some Squid modules (e.g., caching) do not currently
work with native FTP proxying, and many features have not even been tested
for compatibility. Test well before deploying!</P>

<P>Native FTP proxying differs substantially from proxying HTTP requests with
<EM>ftp://</EM> URIs because Squid works as an FTP server and receives
actual FTP commands (rather than HTTP requests with FTP URLs).</P>

<P>FTP Relay highlights:
<UL>
<LI>Added ftp_port directive telling Squid to relay native FTP commands.</LI>
<LI>Active and passive FTP support on the user-facing side; require
passive connections to come from the control connection source IP
address.</LI>
<LI>IPv6 support (EPSV and, on the user-facing side, EPRT).</LI>
<LI>Intelligent adaptation of relayed FTP FEAT responses.</LI>
<LI>Relaying of multi-line FTP control responses using various formats.</LI>
<LI>Support relaying of FTP MLSD and MLST commands (RFC 3659).</LI>
<LI>Several Microsoft FTP server compatibility features.</LI>
<LI>ICAP/eCAP support (at individual FTP command/response level).</LI>
<LI>Optional "current FTP directory" tracking with the assistance of
injected (by Squid) PWD commands (cannot be 100% reliable due to
symbolic links and such, but is helpful in some common use cases).</LI>
<LI>No caching support -- no reliable Request URIs for that (see above).</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.7">2.7</A> <A HREF="#toc2.7">Receive PROXY protocol, Versions 1 &amp; 2</A>
</H2>

<P>More info at 
<A HREF="http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt">http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt</A></P>

<P>PROXY protocol provides a simple way for proxies and tunnels of any kind to
relay the original client source details without having to alter or understand
the protocol being relayed on the connection.</P>

<P>Squid currently supports receiving HTTP traffic from a client proxy using this protocol.
An http_port which has been configured to receive this protocol may only be used to
receive traffic from client software sending in this protocol.
HTTP traffic without the PROXY header is not accepted on such a port.</P>

<P>The <EM>accel</EM> and <EM>intercept</EM> options are still used to identify the HTTP
traffic syntax being delivered by the client proxy.</P>

<P>Squid can be configured by adding an <EM>http_port</EM>
with the <EM>require-proxy-header</EM> mode flag. The <EM>proxy_protocol_access</EM>
must also be configured with <EM>src</EM> ACLs to whitelist proxies which are
trusted to send correct client details.</P>

<P>Forward-proxy traffic from a client proxy:
<PRE>
 acl frontend src 192.0.2.1
 http_port 3128 require-proxy-header
 proxy_protocol_access allow frontend
</PRE>
</P>

<P>Intercepted traffic from a client proxy or tunnel:
<PRE>
 acl frontend src 192.0.2.2
 http_port 3128 intercept require-proxy-header
 proxy_protocol_access allow frontend
</PRE>
</P>

<P>Reverse-proxy traffic from a frontend load balancer sending PROXY protocol:
<PRE>
 acl frontend src 192.0.2.3
 http_port 3128 accel require-proxy-header
 proxy_protocol_access allow frontend
</PRE>
</P>

<P><EM>Known Issue:</EM>
Use of <EM>require-proxy-header</EM> on <EM>https_port</EM> and <EM>ftp_port</EM> is not supported.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.8">2.8</A> <A HREF="#toc2.8">Basic authentication MSNT helper changes</A>
</H2>

<P>The authentication helper previously known as <EM>basic_msnt_auth</EM> has
been deprecated and renamed to <EM>basic_smb_lm_auth</EM> to reflect that
it only performs SMB LanMan protocol(s) instead of modern MS authentication
protocols.</P>

<P>The <EM>basic_smb_lm_auth</EM> helper has been remodelled and no longer uses
configuration files. The Doman Controller servers are now configured via
command line parameters and user credentials are looked up in each DC in the
order configured until one matches or all have confirmed a non-match.</P>

<P>The <EM>MSNT-multi-domain</EM> helper provides the same functionality and
is also deprecated. It will be removed in the Squid-3.6 series.</P>



<H2><A NAME="s3">3.</A> <A HREF="#toc3">Changes to squid.conf since Squid-3.4</A></H2>

<P>There have been changes to Squid's configuration file since Squid-3.4.</P>

<P>Squid supports reading configuration option parameters from external
files using the syntax <EM>parameters("/path/filename")</EM>. For example:
<PRE>
    acl whitelist dstdomain parameters("/etc/squid/whitelist.txt")
</PRE>
</P>

<P>The squid.conf macro <EM>${service_name}</EM> is added to provide the service name
of the process parsing the config.</P>

<P>There have also been changes to individual directives in the config file.</P>
<P>This section gives a thorough account of those changes in three categories:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="#newtags">New tags</A></LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="#modifiedtags">Changes to existing tags</A></LI>

<DT><B>ftp_client_idle_timeout</B><DD>
<P>New directive controlling how long to wait for an FTP request on a
client connection to Squid <EM>ftp_port</EM>.</P>
<P>Many FTP clients do not deal with idle connection closures well,
necessitating a longer default timeout (30 minutes) than
<EM>client_idle_pconn_timeout</EM> used for incoming HTTP requests (2
minutes).</P>
<P>The current default may be changed as we get more experience with FTP relaying.</P>

<DT><B>ftp_port</B><DD>

<P>New directive to specify the time in seconds the TLS/SSL session is valid.</P>

<DT><B>store_id_extras</B><DD>
<P>New directive to send additional lookup parameters to the configured
Store-ID helper program. It takes a string which may contain logformat %macros.</P>
<P>The Store-ID helper input format is now:
<PRE>
         [channel-ID] url [extras]
        
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The default value for extras is: "%&gt;a/%&gt;A %un %&gt;rm myip=%la myport=%lp"</P>

<H2><A NAME="modifiedtags"></A> <A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="#toc3.2">Changes to existing tags</A>
</H2>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>acl</B><DD>
<P>Deprecated type <EM>tag</EM>. Use type <EM>note</EM> with 'tag' key
name instead.</P>
<P>New type <EM>adaptation_service</EM> to match the name of any
icap_service, ecap_service, adaptation_service_set, or
adaptation_service_chain that Squid has used (or attempted to use)
for the HTTP transaction so far.</P>
<P>New type <EM>at_step</EM> to match the current SSL-Bump processing step.
Never matches and should not be used outside of <EM>ssl_bump</EM>.</P>
<P>New types <EM>ssl::server_name</EM> and <EM>ssl::server_name_regex</EM>
to match server name from various sources (CONNECT authority name,
TLS SNI domain, or X.509 certificate Subject Name).</P>

<DT><B>auth_param</B><DD>
<P>New parameter <EM>key_extras</EM> to send additional parameters to
the authentication helper.</P>

<DT><B>cache_dir</B><DD>
<P>New support for larger than 32KB objects in both <EM>rock</EM> type
cache and shared memory cache.</P>

COSS storage type and all COSS specific options are removed.</P>

<DT><B>cache_peer</B><DD>
<P>New <EM>standby=N</EM> option to retain a set of N open and unused
connections to the peer at virtually all times to reduce TCP handshake
delays.</P>
<P>These connections differ from HTTP persistent connections in that they
have not been used for HTTP messaging (and may never be). They may be
turned into persistent connections after their first use subject to the
same keep-alive critera any HTTP connection is checked for.</P>
<P>Squid-2 option <EM>idle=</EM> replaced by <EM>standby=</EM>.</P>
<P>NOTE that standby connections are started earlier and available in
more circumstances than squid-2 idle connections were. They are
also spread over all IPs of the peer.</P>

<DT><B>configuration_includes_quoted_values</B><DD>
<P>Regex pattern values cannot be parsed in parts of squid.conf when this
directive is configured to <EM>ON</EM>. Instead of quoted strings Squid
now accepts regex \-escaped characters (including escaped spaces) in all
regex patterns.</P>

<DT><B>forward_max_tries</B><DD>
<P>Default value increased to <EM>25 destinations</EM> to allow better
contact and IPv4 failover with domains using long lists of IPv6
addresses.</P>

<DT><B>ftp_epsv</B><DD>
<P>Converted into an Access List with allow/deny value driven by ACLs
using Squid standard first line wins matching basis.</P>
<P>The old values of <EM>on</EM> and <EM>off</EM> imply <EM>allow all</EM>
and <EM>deny all</EM> respectively and are now deprecated.
Do not combine use of on/off values with ACL configuration.</P>

<DT><B>http_port</B><DD>
<P><EM>protocol=</EM> option altered to accept protocol version details.
Currently supported values are: HTTP, HTTP/1.1, HTTPS, HTTPS/1.1</P>
<P>New option <EM>require-proxy-header</EM> to mark ports receiving PROXY
protocol version 1 or 2 traffic.</P>

<DT><B>https_port</B><DD>
<P><EM>protocol=</EM> option altered to accept protocol version details.
Currently supported values are: HTTP, HTTP/1.1, HTTPS, HTTPS/1.1</P>

<DT><B>logformat</B><DD>
<P>New format code <EM>%credentials</EM> to log the client credentials token.</P>
<P>New format code <EM>%ssl::&gt;sni</EM> to TLS client SNI sent to Squid.</P>
<P>New format code <EM>%tS</EM> to log transaction start time in
"seconds.milliseconds" format, similar to the existing access.log
"current time" field (%ts.%03tu) which logs the corresponding
transaction finish time.</P>
<P>New format codes <EM>%&lt;rs</EM> and <EM>%&gt;rs</EM> to log request URL
scheme from client or sent to server/peer respectively.</P>
<P>New format codes <EM>%&lt;rd</EM> and <EM>%&gt;rd</EM> to log request URL
domain from client or sent to server/peer respectively.</P>
<P>New format codes <EM>%&lt;rP</EM> and <EM>%&gt;rP</EM> to log request URL
port from client or sent to server/peer respectively.</P>
