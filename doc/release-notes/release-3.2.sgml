<sect>Major new features since Squid-3.1
<p>Squid 3.2 represents a new feature release above 3.1.

<p>The most important of these new features are:
<itemize>
	<item>SMP scalability
	<item>Helper Multiplexer and On-Demand
	<item>Helper Name Changes
	<item>Multi-Lingual manuals
	<item>Solaris 10 pthreads Support (Experimental)
	<item>Surrogate/1.0 protocol extensions to HTTP
	<item>Logging Infrastructure Updated
	<item>Client Bandwidth Limits
        <item> Dynamic SSL Certificate Generation
</itemize>

Most user-facing changes are reflected in squid.conf (see below).


<sect1>SMP scalability
<p>The new "workers" squid.conf option can be used to launch multiple worker
   processes and utilize multiple CPU cores. The overall intent is to make
   multiple workers look like one to an outside observer, while providing
   knobs to customize each worker behavior if needed.

<p>By default, all worker processes are configured identically and do what a
   single Squid instance would have done. Squid.conf macro substitutions and
   conditionals (see below) can be used to customize individual worker
   configurations. In the paragraphs below, "can share" implies "will share by
   default".

<p>Workers can share HTTP, HTTPS, SNMP, ICP, and HTCP listening addresses.
   Configuration related to ICP and HTCP clients must be adjusted to avoid
   source address conflicts: Modify the IP address and/or the port used for
   the protocol. Workers do not share DNS addresses by default because the OS
   assigns each worker a unique DNS port.

<p>Workers can share logs.

<p>Workers cannot share caches, for now. Cache_dir options must be adjusted to
   point each disk-caching worker to its own disk area. ICP and HTCP responses
   are based on the responding worker cache state. Overall, SMP Squid behaves
   as a Squid farm behind a load-balancer with no cache affinity awareness.
   This is perfect for non-caching Squids but inappropriate for Squids that
   must coordinate caching activities (in-between environments are in a gray
   area requiring case-by-case analysis).

<p>Cache manager and SNMP statistics are reported from a worker point of
   view, for now.

<p>Startup, reconfiguration, shutdown, and log rotation are handled as for a
   monolithic Squid. Abnormally terminated workers are restarted while
   other workers continue serving traffic.

<sect2>Squid.conf macros and conditionals
<p>Added support for process_name and process_number macros as well as simple
   if-statement conditionals in squid.conf. These features allow individual
   worker customization in SMP mode. For details, search for "Conditional
   configuration" and "SMP-Related Macros" sections in squid.conf.documented.


<sect1>Helper Multiplexer
<p>The helper multiplexer's purpose is to relieve some of the burden
   Squid has when dealing with slow helpers. It does so by acting as a
   middleman between squid and the actual helpers, talking to Squid via
   the multiplexed concurrent variant of the helper protocol and to the
   helpers via the non-concurrent variant.

<p>Helpers are started on demand, and in theory the muxer can handle up to
   1k helpers per instance. It's up to squid to decide how many helpers
   to start.

<p>The muxer knows nothing about the actual messages being passed around,
   and as such can't really (yet?) compensate for broken helpers.
   It is not yet able to manage dying helpers, but it will.

<p>To configure the multiplexer add its binary name (usually /usr/share/libexec/helper-mux.pl)
   in front of the name of whichever helper is being multiplexed. It takes the helper binary
   path and parameters as its own command parameters. The <em>concurrency</em> setting already
   existing in Squid is used to configure how many child helpers it may run.

<p>For example, a traditional configration is
   <verb>
	url_rewrite_program /your/redirector.sh
	url_rewrite_children 5
   </verb>
   the alternative multiplexer configuration is:
   <verb>
	url_rewrite_program /usr/share/libexec/helper-mux.pl /your/redirector.sh
	url_rewrite_children 1 concurrency=5
   </verb>

<p>Helpers which are already concurrent protocol enabled gain little benefit from the multiplexer
   on most systems. However on some systems where Squid spawning helpers causes excess memory usage
   the reduction in direct helper spawned by Squid can result in a great reduction in resource use.

<p>The helper can be controlled using various signals:
   <itemize>
	<item>SIGHUP: dump the state of all helpers to STDERR
   </itemize>


<sect1>Helpers On-Demand
<p>Traditionally Squid has been configured with a fixed number of helpers and started them during
  it's start and reconfigure phases. This forces the hard configuration problem of how many helpers
  will be needed to be solved before starting Squid in production use.

<p>The on-demand helpers feature allows greater flexibility and resolves this problem by allowing
  maximum, initial and idle thresholds to be configured. Squid will start the initial set during
  start and reconfigure phases. However over the operational use new helpers up to the maxium will
  be started as load demands. The idle threshold determins how many more helpers to start if the
  currently running set is not enough to handle current request loads.

<p>For example, a traditional configration is
   <verb>
	auth_param ntlm /usr/libexec/squid/ntlm_auth
	auth_param ntlm children 200
   </verb>
   the alternative on-demand configuration could be:
   <verb>
	auth_param ntlm /usr/libexec/squid/ntlm_auth
	auth_param ntlm children 200 startup=10 idle=2
   </verb>

<p>The example still permits up to 200 helpers to be running at once under peak traffic loads.
  But only starts 10 when Squid is initialized resulting in a faster boot up.
  When client requests threaten to overload the running helpers an additional 2 will be started.

<p>NOTE: if no <em>startup</em> and <em>idle</em> values are specified the traditional behaviour
  of starting the maximum number of helpers will occur.


<sect1>Helper Name Changes
<p>To improve the understanding of what each helper does and where it should be used the helper binaries
   which are bundled with Squid have undergone a naming change in this release.

<p>Below is a list of the old helper names and what their names have changed to.
   For several helpers the directory name used in --enable-X-helpers configure option has also changed.

<sect1>Multi-Lingual manuals
<p>The man(8) and man(1) pages bundled with Squid are now provided online for all
   versions and beginning with 3.2 they are available in languages other than english.

<p>Details in <url url="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/QualityOfService" name="The Squid wiki">

<p>3.1 began the Internationalization of Squid with the public facing error pages.
   This move begins the Localization of the internal administrator facing manuals.


<sect1>Solaris 10 pthreads Support (Experimental)
<p>Automatic detection and use of the pthreads library available from Solaris 10

<p>The result of this addition means that faster more efficient AUFS cache storage mechanisims
  are now available in Solaris 10.

<p>Support is experimental at this stage due to lack of feedback on the results of enabling it.
  We recommend giving AUFS a try for faster disk storage and encourage feedback.


<sect1>Surrogate/1.0 protocol extensions to HTTP
<p>The <em>Surrogate</em> extensions to HTTP protocol enable an origin web server to specify separate
  cache controls for a reverse proxy acting on its behalf. Previously this was closely tied with the ESI
  feature support in Squid. This release opens Surrogate support to all reverse proxies.

<p>Reverse proxy requests sent on to the web server include the HTTP header <em>Surrogate-Capabilities:</em>
  specifying the capabilities of the reverse proxy along with an ID which can be used to target reponses with
  a <em>Surrogate-Control:</em> HTTP header used instead of the <em>Cache-Control:</em> header.

<p>The default surrogate ID is generated automatically from the Squid site-unique hostname as found by the
  automatic detection or manual configuration of <em>visible_hostname</em> although can be configured
  separately with the <em>httpd_accel_surrogate_id</em> option.

<p><em>Security Considerations:</em> Websites sould be careful of accepting any surrogate ID.
  Older releases of Squid leak the Surrogate-Control headers to external servers.
  This 3.2 series of Squid will now prevent this leakage of its own ID destined responses, however it is possible
  and for some uses desirable to receive external reverse-proxies <em>Surrogate-Capabilities:</em> headers.

<p><em>NOTE:</em> Several operating system distributions historically package Squid with a forced value of
  <em>visible_hostname localhost</em>. If this is done on a Surrogate enabled install a manual re-configuration
  is required to prevent an unacceptable surrogate ID of 'localhost' being generated.


<sect1>Logging Infrastructure Updated
<p>The advanced logging modules introduced in Squid-2.7 are now available from Squid-3.2.

<p>This feature is documented at http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/LogModules

<p>The new infrastructure currently supports several different channels types (modules) ranging from
  direct filesystem logging (stdio, daemon) to network logging (syslog, UDP and TCP). The daemon logging
  interface allows for a custom helper to be written to process logs in real-time.

<p>Upgrading: the <em>access_log</em> was previously logge via what is now called the <em>stdio</em> module.
  This is still supported and used by default if no module is named. For best performance particularly in SMP
  environments we recommend the <em>daemon</em> be used. The provided <em>log_file_daemon</em> helper
  performs the traditional logging to local filesystem.

<p>Additional to this the cache.log can now be limited to a smaller number of files stored.
  Traditionally cache.log.N has been fixed at the same number of rotated files as access.log.N through the
  <em>logfile_rotate</em> setting. The <em>debug_options</em> setting can now be used to configure the number
  of debug cache.log files to rotate through with a <em>rotate=N</em> option. This is particularly useful for
  logging a single cache.log at relatively high debug levels on a high-traffic system. Or one which is
  required to store a long period of access.log and needs to conserve disk space.


<sect1> Client Bandwidth Limits
<p>In mobile environments, Squid may need to limit Squid-to-client bandwidth
   available to individual users, identified by their IP addresses. The IP
   address pool can be as large as a /10 IPv4 network (4 million unique IP
   addresses) and even larger in IPv6 environments. On the other hand, the code
   should support thousands of connections coming from a single IP (e.g.,
   a child proxy).

<p>The implementation is based on storing bandwidth-related "bucket" information
   in the existing "client database" hash (client_db.cc). The old code already
   assigned each client IP a single ClientInfo object, which satisfies the
   client-side IP-based bandwidth pooling requirements. The old hash size is
   increased to support up to 32K concurrent clients if needed.

<p>Client-side pools are configured similarly to server-side ones, but there is
   only one pool class. See client_delay_pools,
   client_delay_initial_bucket_level, client_delay_parameters, and
   client_delay_access in squid.conf. The client_delay_access matches the client
   with delay parameters. It does not pool clients from different IP addresses
   together.

<p>Special care is taken to provide fair distribution of bandwidth among clients
   sharing the same bucket (i.e., clients coming from the same IP address).
   Multiple same-IP clients competing for bandwidth are queued using FIFO
   algorithm. If a bucket becomes empty, the first client among those sharing 
   the bucket is delayed by 1 second before it can attempt to receive more
   response data from Squid.  This delay may need to be lowered in 
   high-bandwidth environments.

<sect1> Dynamic SSL Certificate Generation
<p> SslBump users know how many certificate warnings a single complex site 
(using dedicated image, style, and/or advertisement servers for embedded content)
can generate. The warnings are legitimate and are caused by Squid-provided site
certificate. Two things may be wrong with that certificate:
<itemize>
   <item> Squid certificate is not signed by a trusted authority.
   <item> Squid certificate name does not match the site domain name. 
</itemize>
Squid can do nothing about (A), but in most targeted environments, users will 
trust the "man in the middle" authority and install the corresponding root
certificate.

<p>To avoid mismatch (B), the DynamicSslCert feature concentrates on generating
site certificates that match the requested site domain name. Please note that
the browser site name check does not really add much security in an SslBump
environment where the user already trusts the "man in the middle". The check
only adds warnings and creates page rendering problems in browsers that try to
reduce the number of warnings by blocking some embedded content.

	remains the default used when no module is selected.
	It is recommended to upgrade logging to the faster <em>daemon:</em> module.
	<p>New <em>daemon</em> module to send each log line as text data to a file I/O daemon handling the slow disk I/O.
	New installs, or installs with no logs configured explicitly will use this module by default.

	   <em>idle=N</em> determines how many helper to retain as buffer against sudden traffic loads.
	   <em>concurrency=N</em> previously called <em>auth_param ... concurrency</em> as a separate option.
	<p>Removed Basic, Digest, NTLM, Negotiate <em>auth_param ... concurrency</em> setting option.

	<tag>cache_peer</tag>

	   The old form is deprecated but still accepted.

	<tag>clientside_mark</tag>
	<p>New configuration parameter <em>clientside_mark</em>
	<p>Allows packets leaving Squid on the client side to be marked with a Netfilter mark value in the same way as the existing clientside_tos feature.

        <p><em>%err_code</em> The ID of an error response served by Squid or
          a similar internal error identifier
        <p><em>%err_detail</em> Additional err_code-dependent error information.

	<tag>memory_pools_limit</tag>
	<p>Memory limits have been revised and corrected from 3.1.4 onwards.
	<p>Please check and update your squid.conf to use the text <em>none</em> for no limit instead of the old 0 (zero).
	<p>All users upgrading need to be aware that from Squid-3.3 setting this option to 0 (zero) will mean zero bytes of memory get pooled.

	<tag>qos_flows</tag>
	<p>New options <em>mark</em> and <em>tos</em> and <em>miss</em>
	<p><em>tos</em> retains the original QOS functionality of the IP header TOS field.
	<p><em>mark</em> offers the same functionality, but with a netfilter mark value.
	<p>These options should be placed immediately after qos_flows.
	<p>The <em>tos</em> value is optional in order to maintain backwards compatability.
	<p>The preserve-miss functionality is available with the <em>mark</em> option and requires no kernel patching.
	   It does, however, require libnetfilter_conntrack.
	   This will be included by default if available (see the --without-netfilter-conntrack configure option for more details).
	<p><em>miss</em> sets a value for a cache miss. It is available for both the tos and mark options and takes precedence over the preserve-miss feature.

	<tag>tcp_outgoing_mark</tag>
	<p>New configuration parameter <em>tcp_outgoing_mark</em>
	<p>Allows packets leaving Squid on the server side to be marked with a Netfilter mark value in the same way as the existing tcp_outgoing_tos feature.
	<p>This feature is only available for Netfilter environments.

	<tag>tcp_outgoing_tos</tag>
	<p>This parameter is now compatible with persistent server connections.

	<tag>windows_ipaddrchangemonitor</tag>
	<p>Now only available to be set in Windows builds.

	<tag>url_rewrite_children</tag>
	<p>New options <em>startup=N</em>, <em>idle=N</em>, <em>concurrency=N</em>
	<itemize>
		<item>startup=N allow finer tuning of how many helpers are started initially.
		<item>idle=N allow fine tuning of how many helper to retain as buffer against sudden traffic loads.
		<item>concurrency=N was previously called url_rewrite_concurrency as a distinct directive.

<sect>Changes to ./configure options since Squid-3.1
<p>
There have been some changes to Squid's build configuration since Squid-3.1.

This section gives an account of those changes in three categories:

<itemize>
	<item><ref id="newoptions" name="New options">
	<item><ref id="modifiedoptions" name="Changes to existing options">
	<item><ref id="removedoptions" name="Removed options">
</itemize>


<sect1>New options<label id="newoptions">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>--enable-auth-basic[=HELPERS]</tag>
	<p>Specified without any parameters all helpers will be auto-built.
	<p>With an explicit empty list <em>=""</em> protocol support will be built but no helpers.
	<p>With an explicit list protocol support and just those helpers will be built.

	<tag>--enable-auth-digest[=HELPERS]</tag>
	<p>Specified without any parameters all helpers will be auto-built.
	<p>With an explicit empty list <em>=""</em> protocol support will be built but no helpers.
	<p>With an explicit list protocol support and just those helpers will be built.

	<tag>--enable-auth-negotiate</tag>
	<p>Specified without any parameters all helpers will be auto-built.
	<p>With an explicit empty list <em>=""</em> protocol support will be built but no helpers.
	<p>With an explicit list protocol support and just those helpers will be built.

	<tag>--enable-auth-ntlm</tag>
	<p>Specified without any parameters all helpers will be auto-built.
	<p>With an explicit empty list <em>=""</em> protocol support will be built but no helpers.
	<p>With an explicit list protocol support and just those helpers will be built.

	<tag>--enable-build-info</tag>
	<p>Add an additional string in the output of "squid -v".

	<tag>--enable-eui</tag>
	<p>Enable Support for handling EUI operations.
	   This includes ARP lookups for MAC (EUI-48) addresses and the ACL arp type tests.

	<tag>--enable-log-daemon-helpers</tag>
	<p>Build helpers for logging I/O.

	<tag>--enable-url-rewrite-helpers</tag>
	<p>Build helpers for some basic URL-rewrite actions. For use by url_rewrite_program.
	   If omitted or set to =all then all bundled helpers that are able to build will be built.
	   If set to a specific list of helpers then only those helpers will build.
	   Currently one demo helper <em>fake</em> is provided in shell and C++ forms to demonstrate
	   the helper protocol usage and provide exemplar code.

	<tag>--with-swapdir=PATH</tag>
	<p>Location to display in documentation for the default cache.
	   Updated to indicate /var/cache/squid in accordance with the filesystem layout standards.
	   Squid-3 no longer builds an implicit disk cache at this location, so the change is not expected
	   to have any effect on existing builds other than fixing some mysterious lack of core dumps.
	   The old /var/cache location was often non-writable which blocked core dumps creation.

	<tag>--without-netfiler-conntrack</tag>
	<p>Disables the libnetfilter_conntrack library being used for the new qos_flows option <em>mark</em>.
	   default is to auto-detect the library and use where available.

        <tag>--enable-ssl-crtd</tag>
        <p>  Prevent Squid from directly generation of SSL private key and 
        certificate request and instead enables the ssl_crtd processes.
</descrip>

<sect1>Changes to existing options<label id="modifiedoptions">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>--enable-auth</tag>
	<p>No longer takes a list of arguments. This option now is restricted to building with or without for authentication.
	<p>The new <em>--enable-auth-X</em>/<em>--disable-auth-X</em> parameters determine which authentication protocols and helpers are built.

</descrip>
