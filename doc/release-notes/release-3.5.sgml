<sect>Notice
<p>
The Squid Team are pleased to announce the release of Squid-3.5.0.0 for testing.

This new release is available for download from <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/"> or the
 <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Mirrors/http-mirrors.html" name="mirrors">.

While this release is not deemed ready for production use, we believe it is ready for wider testing by the community.

We welcome feedback and bug reports. If you find a bug, please see <url url="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/BugReporting">
 for how to submit a report with a stack trace.

<sect1>Known issues
<p>
Although this release is deemed good enough for use in many setups, please note the existence of 
<url url="http://bugs.squid-cache.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&amp;product=Squid&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;version=3.5" name="open bugs against Squid-3.5">.

<sect1>Changes since earlier releases of Squid-3.5
<p>
The 3.5 change history can be <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/" name="viewed here">.


<sect>Major new features since Squid-3.4
<p>Squid 3.5 represents a new feature release above 3.4.

<p>The most important of these new features are:
<itemize>
	<item>Support libecap v1.0
	<item>Authentication helper query extensions
	<item>Support named services
	<item>Upgraded squidclient tool
	<item>Helper support for concurrency channels
	<item>Receive PROXY protocol, Versions 1 & 2
</itemize>

Most user-facing changes are reflected in squid.conf (see below).


<sect1>Support libecap v1.0
<p>Details at <url url="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/BLAH">.

<p>The new libecap version allows Squid to better check the version of
  the eCAP adapter being loaded as well as the version of the eCAP library
  being used.

<p>Squid-3.5 can support eCAP adapters built with libecap v1.0,
   but no longer supports adapters built with earlier libecap versions
   due to API changes.


<sect1>Authentication helper query extensions
<p>Details at <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/auth_param/">.

<p>The new <em>key_extras</em> parameter allows sending of additional
  details to the authentication helper beyond the minimum required for
  the HTTP authentication. This is primarily intended to allow switching
  of authentication databases based on criteria such as client IP subnet,
  Squid receiving port, or in reverse-proxy the requested domain name.

<p>In theory any <em>logformat</em> code may be used, however only the
  codes which have available details at the time of authentication
  will send any meaningful detail.


<sect1>Support named services
<p>Details at <url url="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/MultipleInstances">.
<p>Terminology details at <url url="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SmpScale#Terminology">.

<p>The command line option <em>-n</em> assigns a name to the Squid service
   instance to be used as a unique identifier for all SMP processes run as
   part of that instance. This allows multiple instances of Squid service to
   be run on a single machine without background SMP systems such as shared
   memory and inter-process communication becoming confused or requiring
   additional configuration.

<p>A service name is always used. When the <em>-n</em> option is missing
   from the command line the default service name is <em>squid</em>.

<p>When multiple instances are being run the <em>-n</em> service name is
   required to target all other options such as <em>-z</em> or <em>-k</em>
   commands at the correct service.

<p>The squid.conf macro ${service_name} is added to provide the service name
   of the process parsing the config.


<sect1>Upgraded squidclient tool
<p>The <em>squidclient</em> has begun the process of upgrading to support
   protocols other than HTTP.

<sect2>Debug levels
<p>The tool displays the server response message on STDOUT unless the <em>-q</em>
   command line option is used. Error messages will be output to STDERR.
   All other possible output is considered debug and output to STDERR using
   a range of debug verbosity levels (currently 1, 2 and 3).

<p>When the <em>-v</em> command line option is used debugging is enabled.
   The level of debug display is raised for each repetition of the option.

<sect2>PING
<p>When <em>--ping</em> is given the tool will send its message repeatedly
   using whichever protocol that message has been formatted for.
   Optional parameters to limit the number of pings and their frequency are
   available.

<p>Older tool versions also provide this feature but require the loop count
   parameter to be set to enable use of the feature.

<sect2>HTTPS
<p>When Squid is built with the GnuTLS encryption library the tool is able
   to open TLS (or SSL/3.0) connections to servers.

<p>The <em>--https</em> option enables TLS using default values.

<p>The <em>--cert</em> option specifies a file containing X.509 client
   certificate and private key in PEM format to be loaded for use. Multiple
   certificates are supported and the option may be used multiple times to
   load certificates.
   The default is not to use a client certificate.

<p>The <em>--params</em> option specifies a library specific set of parameters
   to be sent to the library for configuring the security context.
   See <url url="http://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Priority-Strings.html"> for
   available GnuTLS parameters.

<p>The <em>--trusted-ca</em> option specifies a file in PEM format containing
   one or more Certificate Authority (CA) certificates used to verify the
   remote server. This option may be used multiple times to load additional
   CA certificate lists.
   The default is not to use any CA, nor trust any server.

<p>Anonymous TLS (using non-authenticated Diffi-Hellman or Elliptic Curve
   encryption) is available with the <em>--anonymous-tls</em> option.
   The default is to use X.509 certificate encryption instead.

<p>When performing TLS/SSL server certificates are always verified, the
   results shown at debug level 3. The encrypted type is displayed at debug
   level 2 and the connection is used to send and receive the messages
   regardless of verification results.


<sect1>Helper support for concurrency channels
<p>Helper concurrency greatly reduces the communication lag between Squid
   and its helpers allowing faster transaction speeds even on sequential
   helpers.

<p>The Digest authentication, Store-ID, and URL-rewrite helpers packaged
   with Squid have been updated to support concurrency channels. They will
   auto-detect the <em>channel-ID</em> field and will produce the appropriate
   response format.
   With these helpers concurrency may now be set to 0 or any higher number as desired.


<sect1>Receive PROXY protocol, Versions 1 & 2
<p>More info at <url url="http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt">

<p>PROXY protocol provides a simple way for proxies and tunnels of any kind to
   relay the original client source details without having to alter or understand
   the protocol being relayed on the connection.

<p>Squid currently supports receiving HTTP traffic from a client proxy using this protocol.
   An http_port which has been configured to receive this protocol may only be used to
   receive traffic from client software sending in this protocol.
   Regular forward-proxy HTTP traffic is not accepted.

<p>The <em>accel</em> and <em>intercept</em> options are still used to identify the
   traffic syntax being delivered by the client proxy.

<p>Squid can be configured by adding an <em>http_port</em>
   with the <em>proxy-surrogate</em> mode flag. The <em>proxy_forwarded_access</em>
   must also be configured with <em>src</em> ACLs to whitelist proxies which are
   trusted to send correct client details.

<p>Forward-proxy traffic from a client proxy:
<verbatim>
 http_port 3128 proxy-surrogate
 proxy_forwarded_access allow localhost
</verbatim>

<p>Intercepted traffic from a client proxy or tunnel:
<verbatim>
 http_port 3128 intercept proxy-surrogate
 proxy_forwarded_access allow localhost
</verbatim>

<p><em>Known Issue:</em>
   Use of <em>proxy-surrogate</em> on <em>https_port</em> is not supported.


<sect>Changes to squid.conf since Squid-3.4
<p>
There have been changes to Squid's configuration file since Squid-3.4.

<p>Squid supports reading configuration option parameters from external
   files using the syntax <em>parameters("/path/filename")</em>. For example:
<verb>
    acl whitelist dstdomain parameters("/etc/squid/whitelist.txt")
</verb>

<p>The squid.conf macro ${service_name} is added to provide the service name
   of the process parsing the config.

<p>There have also been changes to individual directives in the config file.

This section gives a thorough account of those changes in three categories:

<itemize>
	<item><ref id="newtags" name="New tags">
	<item><ref id="modifiedtags" name="Changes to existing tags">
	<item><ref id="removedtags" name="Removed tags">
</itemize>
<p>

<sect1>New tags<label id="newtags">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>collapsed_forwarding</tag>
	<p>Ported from Squid-2 with no configuration or visible behaviour changes.
           Collapsing of requests is performed across SMP workers.

	<tag>proxy_forwarded_access</tag>
	<p>Renamed from <em>follow_x_forwarded_for</em> and extended to control more
	   ways for locating the indirect (original) client IP details.

	<tag>send_hit</tag>
	<p>New configuration directive to enable/disable sending cached content
	   based on ACL selection. ACL can be based on client request or cached
	   response details.

	<tag>sslproxy_session_cache_size</tag>
	<p>New directive which sets the cache size to use for TLS/SSL sessions cache.

	<tag>sslproxy_session_ttl</tag>
	<p>New directive to specify the time in seconds the TLS/SSL session is valid.

	<tag>store_id_extras</tag>
	<p>New directive to send additional lookup parameters to the configured
	   Store-ID helper program. It takes a string which may contain logformat %macros.
	<p>The Store-ID helper input format is now:
	<verb>
         [channel-ID] url [extras]
	</verb>
	<p>The default value for extras is: "%&gt;a/%>A %un %>rm myip=%la myport=%lp"

	<tag>store_miss</tag>
	<p>New configuration directive to enable/disable caching of MISS responses.
	   ACL can be based on any request or response details.

	<tag>url_rewrite_extras</tag>
	<p>New directive to send additional lookup parameters to the configured
	   URL-rewriter/redirector helper program. It takes a string which may
	   contain logformat %macros.
	<p>The url rewrite and redirector helper input format is now:
	<verb>
         [channel-ID] url [extras]
	</verb>
	<p>The default value for extras is: "%>a/%>A %un %>rm myip=%la myport=%lp"

</descrip>

<sect1>Changes to existing tags<label id="modifiedtags">
<p>
<descrip>
	<tag>acl</tag>
	<p>New type <em>adaptation_service</em> to match the name of any
	   icap_service, ecap_service, adaptation_service_set, or
	   adaptation_service_chain that Squid has used (or attempted to use)
	   for the HTTP transaction so far.

	<tag>auth_param</tag>
	<p>New parameter <em>key_extras</em> to send additional parameters to
	   the authentication helper.

	<tag>cache_dir</tag>
	<p>New support for larger than 32KB objects in both <em>rock</em> type
	   cache and shared memory cache.
	<p>New <em>slot-size=N</em> option for rock cache to specify the database
	   slot/page size when small slot sizes are desired. The default and
	   maximum slot size is 32KB.
	<p>Removal of old rock cache dir followed by <em>squid -z</em> is required
	   when upgrading from earlier versions of Squid.

	<tag>cache_peer</tag>
	<p>New <em>standby=N</em> option to retain a set of N open and unused
	   connections to the peer at virtually all times to reduce TCP handshake
	   delays.
	<p>These connections differ from HTTP persistent connections in that they
	   have not been used for HTTP messaging (and may never be). They may be
	   turned into persistent connections after their first use subject to the
	   same keep-alive critera any HTTP connection is checked for.

	<tag>forward_max_tries</tag>
	<p>Default value increased to <em>25 destinations</em> to allow better
	   contact and IPv4 failover with domains using long lists of IPv6
	   addresses.

	<tag>ftp_epsv</tag>
	<p>Converted into an Access List with allow/deny value driven by ACLs
	   using Squid standard first line wins matching basis.
	<p>The old values of <em>on</em> and <em>off</em> imply <em>allow all</em>
	    and <em>deny all</em> respectively and are now deprecated.
	   Do not combine use of on/off values with ACL configuration.

	<tag>http_port</tag>
	<p><em>protocol=</em> option altered to accept protocol version details.
	   Currently supported values are: HTTP, HTTP/1.1, HTTPS, HTTPS/1.1
	<p><em>New option <em>proxy-surrogate</em> to mark ports receiving PROXY
	   protocol version 1 or 2 traffic.

	<tag>https_port</tag>
	<p><em>protocol=</em> option altered to accept protocol version details.
	   Currently supported values are: HTTP, HTTP/1.1, HTTPS, HTTPS/1.1

	<tag>logformat</tag>
	<p>New format code <em>%credentials</em> to log the client credentials
	   token.
	<p>New format code <em>%tS</em> to log transaction start time in
	   "seconds.milliseconds" format, similar to the existing access.log
	   "current time" field (%ts.%03tu) which logs the corresponding
	   transaction finish time.
