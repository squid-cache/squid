Release Notes, Version 1.8

Ryan Troll <ryan@andrew.cmu.edu>

Major Changes:

Portability / Bug Fixes
#######################

Incorporated patches from Par Westesson <pw@cbc.chalmers.se>.  Par's
description of the patches sent to me:

- The SNMPv2 error code definitions in asn1.c have been fixed.  [ They
  were previously listed as Hex values, instead of decimal. ]

- The function snmp_var_EncodeVarBind in snmp_vars.c has been modified
  to be able to encode the exception values noSuchObject,
  noSuchInstance and endOfMibView. It does so using the definitions
  added in snmp_vars.h and the function asn_build_exception added in
  asn1.c.

  Note that we haven't included support for decoding these exceptions
  (since we're using the library in an agent rather than a manager).
  Including support for this would however only require some small
  changes to the function snmp_var_DecodeVarBind and the addition of
  an asn_parse_exception function.

  We also haven't made any changes to the print_type function in
  mib.c, so these values can't be printed. Otherwise, no other changes
  to the library should be necessary because of the inclusion of the
  support for the exceptions.

- All calls to the macro ASN_PARSE_ERROR which increments the counter
  snmpInASNParseErrs have been removed from the functions that encode
  SNMP packets since it should only be used when decoding. This
  affects the files snmp_vars.c, snmp_msg.c and snmp_pdu.c.

Incorporated patches from Sebastien Rosset
(sebastien.rosset@cstelecom.cie-signaux.fr):

- Patches that augment Par's changes for noSuchObject, etc.

- Fixed a bug when trying to deal with Bulk requests



MAX_OID_LEN is now correctly set to 128 subids.

Removed bcmp, bzero calls, for Solaris 2.4.

Parser now handles description fields that begin with a quote
immediately followed by a word, instead of failing.  (Thanks to Simon
Burr <simonb@uk.uu.net>)

Release Notes, Version 1.7
October 14, 1997
Ryan Troll <ryan@andrew.cmu.edu>

Major changes:

Portability / Bug Fixes
#######################

Incorporated patches for compilation under Visual C++ 4.0 / WinNT.
(Thanks to Steven Chew <smchew@ibm.net>)

It is now possible to compile the Irix version with '-n32', '-32', or
'-o32' and have it installed into the appropriate place with the
"--with-mips-abi=[n32,o32,32]" flag to configure.  (Thanks to Rob
Earhart <earhart+@cmu.edu>)

Incorporated patch for socket options under Linux.  Now sending UDP
packets to remote hosts that are unavailable should not hurt anything
else.  (Thanks to Chaskiel Grundman <cg2v+@andrew.cmu.edu>)

Other
#####

The included MIB is now correct, and expanded.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Release Notes, Version 1.6
May 27, 1997
Ryan Troll <ryan@andrew.cmu.edu>

Major changes:

Portability / Bug Fixes
#######################

Correct use of int/long, so that machines using 64bit longs may use
the library.

Miniclient function declarations (and others) are now wrapped within
the appropriate c++ wrappers.

Added timer defines, to allow the library to compile with the Cygnus
Win32 compiler.

Now handles returns strings that are (supposedly) allocated yet
contain no information.

Fixed a few calls to asn functions that were passing sizeof(Pointer)
rather than sizeof(what pointer points to), which weren't caught when
these were the same.  (But, on 64 bit machines...)


Informs
#######

The built-in snmp PDU/Session management now correctly handles SNMP
Informs.  


Parser
######

The parser now accepts two additional pieces of information in a mib:
DESCRIPTION and INDEX.  It also handles "ACCESS" and "MAX-ACCESS".
With these additions, SNMPv2 SMI MIBs can be parsed with minimal
changes.  (Specifically, with the removal of text conventions, etc.)

The included CMU MIB should be a good example.


Other
#####

Changed some symbol names to static, to help reduce symbol name
conflict with applications.

Corrected incorrect backwards-compatibility defines.

Release Notes, Version 1.5
March 31, 1997
Ryan Troll <ryan@andrew.cmu.edu>



This SNMP library is based on the SNMP1.1b library that has been
available via ftp.net.cmu.edu since September of 1991.  Many changes
have been made to increase it's performance, clean up memory leaks,
and prepare it for use with SNMPv2 managers and agents.


This is the last release of the CMU SNMP Library, aside from bug fixes
and portability patches. Future SNMP development will be in a new
direction. The new CMU SNMP library will be fully object oriented;
compatible with SNMPv1, SNMPv2 Classic, and possibly others; and
handle SMIv2 MIBs with the use of a MIB Compiler (IE: SMICng). 

The major changes since CMU SNMP 1.1b are:

Autoconf
########

The SNMP Library now uses GNU Autoconf to determine system specific
information. 

Trap and PDU Type Definitions
#############################

All well-known traps and PDUs are now defined snmp_pdu.h, and are of
the format SNMP_TRAP_${TrapType} and SNMP_PDU_${PDUType}.  All defines
previously used to specify trap and pdu type should still work. 

Installation Directories
########################

The library is now installed in $(exec_prefix)/lib, and the include
files are installed in $(exec_prefix)/include.

Includes
########

Applications now only need to include <snmp/snmp.h>, instead of
all the separate headers required previously.

MiniClient
##########

This library now contains a mini-client.  The miniclient only
implements the Get, GetNext, and Set functions.  By using the
miniclient, SNMP capable applications may be quickly generated.  (We
use the miniclient for most of our internal monitoring stuff.)

Optimizations
#############

Various parts of the library have been optimized.  The most
significant optimization adds 6 bytes to every outgoing packet the
length identifiers for the Message, PDU, and Variable List SEQUENCEs
are now all encoded in three bytes instead of 1.  However, this
reduces the number of iterations over the variable list during
encoding from 4 to 1.  There is also no delayed range shifting of the
entire encoded stream to insert a better length.

Purify
######

All of the SNMP Applications we've compiled using this library have
been purified, and all errors / complaints / warnings have been taken
care of.  Based on this, we believe the library is free of memory
leaks

Trap Generation
###############

There are no longer routines for trap generation within this library.
This may be done by the application.

V1 - V2 Coexistance
###################

There are two functions (snmp_coexist_V2toV1 and snmp_coexist_V1toV2)
that should provide V1-V2 coexistance per RFC 1908.  However, these
have not been tested.

Version
#######

The snmp_session structure now contains a variable called "Version".
This variable specifies the default version of all incoming / outgoing
data for this session.
