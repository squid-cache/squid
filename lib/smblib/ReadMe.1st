SMBlib 0.20
Richard Sharpe
Digital Equipment Corporation 

This is a first attempt at an SMBlibrary, and is incomplete. 

I wrote it in an attempt to understand more about the SMB protocol and
the RFCNB (NBT) protocol underlying it. My manager approved my posting this
as long as there was no suggestion that Digital is responsible for this code 
not that any warranties are offered by Digital. So, I put a GPL on the code.

DISCLAIMER

To restate, this code is offered as is, and no warranties are implied, either 
by Digital Equipment Corporation or by Richard Sharpe. Neither 
Digital Equipment Corporation nor Richard Sharpe can be held liable for 
any consequences resulting from the use of this code.

END Disclaimer

At the moment, it can connect to Windows NT servers, Windows 95 servers, 
PATHWORKS 4 VMS and PATHWORKS 4 Ultrix servers, as well as Samba.

It can Connect, Negotiate a protocol, logon to a Samba Server, Logon to
Windows NT, Logon to LAN Manager 2.2 (for UNIX) server, connect to a tree, 
open a file, create a file, read a file, write a file, delete a file,
close a file, disconnect a tree connection, create a directory, delete a 
directory, check a directory. 
This represents about 75% of the core protocol.

It has a number of deficiencies:

a. It does not do any more than the Core Protocol (except for logon).

b. Because of the structure of the code, it is not going to be easy to use 
   the And_X commands properly.

c. It will not be easy to use OPLOCKS (if I understand them well) as they 
   will result in unsolicited SMBs from the server to break locks.

d. It does not check that SMBs received are in response to SMBs sent. This
   is a lack of defensive programming.

e. It is not thread safe.

It is offered as an example for those who might want to take things
further. I am unhappy about the way that some things have panned out,
and may tinker with this some more over time. I am also happy to answer
questions, time permitting.

The files here are:

Makefile:             a small makefile to build things in this dir ...

smblib.h:             include file of interface routines for SMBlib

smblib-priv.h:        include file of internal stuff to SMBlib

std-defines.h:        some standard defines I needed.

smblib.c:             the beginnings of routines that connect and logon

file.c:               the beginings of routines that do SMB file ops

smblib-util.c:        utility routines for SMBlib

test_smblib.c:        a small test program

test_perf.c:          the beginings of a performance test routine ...

usage.txt:            some documentation on using all the routines ...

Testing:

This has been compiled and tested on ULTRIX and Digital UNIX, and some 
testing has been done on Linux, but I have not tested it on any other 
versions of UNIX.
