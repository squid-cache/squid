Using SMBlib
Richard Sharpe

This file describes how to use the SMBlib routines. It takes the form of a 
program that might use many of thr routines with text describing the routines 
used.

I wrote it in an attempt to understand more about the SMB protocol and
the RFCNB (NBT) protocol underlying it. My manager approved my posting this
as long as there was no suggestion that Digital is responsible for this code 
not that any warranties are offered by Digital. So, I put a GPL on the code.

DISCLAIMER

To restate, this code is offered as is, and no warranties are implied, either 
by Digital Equipment Corporation or by Richard Sharpe. Neither 
Digital Equipment Corporation nor Richard Sharpe can be held liable for 
any consequences resulting from the use of this code.

I have pulled this code from other test routines, and I make no guarantee that
what I have here will actually compile. It is simply meant to show you how to
use SMBlib.

STARING A PROGRAM

You will need some includes ...

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include "SMBlib-SOURCE-DIR/smblib.h"

INITIALIZING SMBlib

  SMB_Init()

This initializes the SMBlib routines.

CONNECTING TO A SERVER

First, you have to connect to a share on a server. There are a couple of ways 
of doing this. The easiest is:

                    P1    P2            P3       P4

  con = SMB_Connect(NULL, service_name, "Guest", password);

where:

  P1 is a handle to a connection structure you might already have. NULL
     if you want SMB_Connect to create one.

  P2 is the name of the service you want to connect to, in the form of:

     \\server-name\share

  P3 is the account name to log on as. This is really ignored by SMB_Connect
     at the moment.

  P4 is the password to use in connecting to the share.

SMB_Connect connects to the server, negotiates the Core Protocol, and connects
to the tree represented by the share that is specified.

If a problem occurs, it returns NULL. You can check for errors doing the 
following.

  void *con;

  if (con == NULL) { /* Error ... */

    fprintf(stderr, "Unable to connect ... \n");

    error = SMB_Get_Last_Error();                  /* Find out the problem */

Pick up the error from SMBlib and decode it.

    if (error == SMBlibE_Remote) {  /* Pick up the class and code */

      SMB_Error = SMB_Get_Last_SMB_Err();

      fprintf(stderr, "\tError Class = %i, Error Code = %i\n",
	      SMBlib_Error_Class(SMB_Error), SMBlib_Error_Code(SMB_Error));

    }
    else { /* Some error code from SMBlib ... */

      SMB_Get_Error_Msg(error, error_message, sizeof(error_message) - 1);

      fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", error_message);

    }

    exit(1);    /* Or whatever else you want to do ... */

  }

If you want to connect the hard way, you will need to call three routines, 
SMB_Connect_Server, SMB_Negotiate, and SMB_TreeConnect. An example is:

  char *SMB_Prots[] = {"PC NETWORK PROGRAM 1.0", 
			    "MICROSOFT NETWORKS 1.03",
			    "MICROSOFT NETWORKS 3.0",
			    "LANMAN1.0",
			    "LM1.2X002",
			    "Samba",
			    "NT LM 0.12",
			    "NT LANMAN 1.0",
			    NULL};

Here we connect to the server, whose name is in the variable server.

  con = SMB_Connect_Server(NULL, server);

Here we do some primitive error checking. Use the example above for better
error checking.

  if (con == NULL) { /* Error ... */

    fprintf(stderr, "Unable to connect to server \"%s\" ... \n", server);
    RFCNB_Get_Error(err_string, sizeof(err_string));
    printf("Error in calling: %s ...\n", err_string);
    exit(1);

  }

Here we negotiate a protocol. We pass a list of the protocol strings we will
accepty as the second parameter.

  /* Now do a negotiate ... */

  fprintf(stderr, "Now we negotiate a protocol ... \n");

  if (SMB_Negotiate(con, SMB_Prots) < 0) { /* An error */

    fprintf(stderr, "Unable to negotiate a protocol ...\n");
    RFCNB_Get_Error(err_string, sizeof(err_string));
    printf("Error in calling: %s ...\n", err_string);
    exit(1);

  }

If we wnat to find out the protocol that was negotiated then we can do the 
following:

  protocol = SMB_Get_Protocol_IDX(con);

This returns us the index of the protocol in SMB_Prots that was accepted, or 
0xFFFF if connection handle is invalid.

  /* Now we do a logon ... */

  fprintf(stderr, "Now try to logon as %s ...\n", user);

  if (SMB_Logon_Server(con, user, password) < 0) {

This code will logon to an NT 3.51 server or to Samba or to a LAN Manager for
UNIX 2.2 server. It is the only part of SMBlib that knows about NT LM 0.12 
or LM1.2X002 at this stage.

    fprintf(stderr, "Unable to logon to server ...\n");
    RFCNB_Get_Error(err_string, sizeof(err_string));
    printf("Error in logging on: %s ...\n", err_string);
    exit(1);

  }

  sprintf(service_unc, "\\\\%s\\%s", server, service);

Now we connect to a tree. This takes the connection handle, a service name, a 
password, and a service type (A:, LPT:, etc). If you want a Microsoft
developed server to connect you, you better use A: for the service type for a 
disk service.

  void *tree;

  if (tree = SMB_TreeConnect(con, service, password, service_type) == NULL) {

    fprintf(stderr, "Unable to connect to the tree ...\n");
    RFCNB_Get_Error(err_string, sizeof(err_string));
    fprintf(stderr, "  Error trying to connect: %s \n", err_string);
  }

OPENING FILES

To open a file on the server, use the following call, which gives back a file 
handle:

                  P1    P2    P3         P4                P5

  file = SMB_Open(tree, NULL, file_name, SMB_AMODE_OPENRW, SMB_FA_ORD);

where:

  P1 is the tree handle from an earlier SMB_TreeConnect

  P2 is a file handle or NULL. If NULL is passed, a new file handle will be
     created

  P3 is the file you want opened.

  P4 is the mode that you want it opened under. See smblib-common.h for the
     defines.

  P5 is the type of file, whether an ordinary (normal), hidden, system, etc.

If SMB_Open returns NULL, an error has occurred, so use the sort of error
handling code shown for SMB_Connect above.

There are many more things that can be done. See the program test_smblib.c for
examples of doing all of the following:
