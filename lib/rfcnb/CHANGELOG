Oct 2010 - Imported into Squid.
           Many build fixes for modern compilers.
           Shuffled several private functions (error display and logon) to
           to public API file for external use without using rfcnb-priv.h.

Aug-1996

Added #define of INADDR_NONE if not already defined, as Suns do not seem
to define it.

6-Sep-1996

Fixed bug in rfcnb-priv.h where we were getting the packet length wrong
(byte reversed on Suns ...) ... At least I think it is fixed. Will
test.

6-Sep-1996

Use siganction on machines where SA_RESTART is defined, otherwise use
sigvec. This allows the code to compile on Sun, and maybe on HP-UX.

13-Sep-1996

Fixed that bug in rfcnb-priv.h again in RFCNB_Pkt_Len. We were not
shifting the second length byte into the right place.
