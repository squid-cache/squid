RFCNB
Richard Sharpe,
Digital Equipment

I wrote it in an attempt to understand more about the SMB protocol and
the RFCNB (NBT) protocol underlying it. My manager approved my posting this
as long as there was no suggestion that Digital is responsible for this code 
not that any warranties are offered by Digital. So, I put a GPL on the code.

DISCLAIMER

To restate, this code is offered as is, and no warranties are implied, either 
by Digital Equipment Corporation or by Richard Sharpe. Neither 
Digital Equipment Corporation nor Richard Sharpe can be held liable for 
any consequences resulting from the use of this code.

END Disclaimer
