To build and install the Squid Cache, type:

	% ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/squid
        % make all
        % make install

To run a Cache, you will need to:

	1. customize the squid.conf configuration file:
	      % vi /usr/local/squid/etc/squid.conf

	2. Initalise the cache:
	      % /usr/local/squid/sbin/squid -z
	      
	3. start the cache:
	      % /usr/local/squid/sbin/squid

If you want to use the WWW interface to the Cache Manager, copy
the tools/cachemgr.cgi program into your httpd server's cgi-bin
directory.
