Change the prefix variable in ./Makefile to be the directory in which
you would like to install the Harvest Cache.  The default is
/usr/local/harvest.

To build and install the Harvest Cache, type:

        % make all
        % make install

To run a Cache, you will need to:

	1. set the HARVEST_HOME environment variable, as appropriate:
	      % setenv HARVEST_HOME /usr/local/harvest

	2. customize the cached.conf configuration file:
	      % vi $HARVEST_HOME/lib/cached.conf

	3. start the cache:
	      % $HARVEST_HOME/bin/RunCache

If you want to use the WWW interface to the Cache Manager, copy
the cachemgr.cgi program into your httpd server's cgi-bin
directory.

Alternatively, you can configure your HTTP server to recognize CGI
scripts in $HARVEST_HOME/cgi-bin.  For example, with NCSA httpd, add
this line to the srm.conf file:

        ScriptAlias /Harvest/cgi-bin/ Your-HARVEST_HOME/cgi-bin/

Then, use <URL:http://host/Harvest/cgi-bin/cachemgr.cgi> to access the
WWW interface to the Cache Manager.

For further or more detailed instructions on how to run the Cache, 
refer to the Harvest User's Manual:
